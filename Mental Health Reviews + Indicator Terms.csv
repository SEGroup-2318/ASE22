1,"i am thankful to my therapist for being responsive, and checking in at least once a day. he was also respectful and professional. i did get 1-2 nuggets of useful advice. however, i found the therapy lacking in many ways and ultimately unhelpful. i was hoping for insight into my situations, but most responses i got were very basicÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âeither easily googled or common sense. still i was hopeful and wanted to give it a chance. i reiterated my goals with my therapist so he knew i wasnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât just here to vent, that i was looking for deeper understanding of what was going on. i continued to find the responses more of repetitions of what i said rather than anything i could learn from. i even tried nudging him in the right direction by suggesting possible explanations i learned from my own reading, hoping he would delve deeper. in response my therapist would agree with me and give a one sentence Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âelaboration.Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â i felt he was just trying to keep me happy and Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âfeeling heard,Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â but i couldnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât get much depth or new information from him. he honestly seemed to be trying his best but either through lack of skill/knowledge or the formatÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs limitations, this therapy did not deliver. after a few weeks i found that answering the messages felt like a chore. i responded to the therapist just to get it off my to do list. i wasnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât getting anything useful from it.

 

btw, i was a little put off that i had to include an emergency contactÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs full name and phone number. i had hoped for some anonymity due to the personal nature of things i would talk about. i tried to give just a first name, but he would not continue without a first and last name, and phone number. 

overall, from my experience i donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât think this format of therapy is going to help people looking for real therapy. the delay in response time (which to be fair, they warn you about) and that itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs written, makes it hard to connect or get deeper. not sure who this would work for? it really makes me wonder about the validity of some of these reviews.... if you want to pay $300+ a month for someone to read your texts and agree with you then sure. but i regret opening up about highly personal things and spending the money i did. i feel i can get better information googling mental health advice than from this.",5/18/2020 15:17,talkspace,apple,last name,,,1

1,"deciding to try to get some help myself was a difficult decision. i badly wanted this to work out for me, but a lack of support from talkspace eventually left me in a worse place than when i started. 

talkspace fails on every promise made in the description. while it may be convenient to type out what youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âre feeling in the app, this is effectively like yelling into a black hole. at no point did i feel confident that all my messages were read. there was no continuity on the responses that could ever constitute an actual conversation. the five or so total messages i received in the course of a week were just generalized patronization, with no thought or concern for anything i was actually trying to convey.

the service is in no way discrete of anonymous. youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âll be forced to provide details information on yourself, your location, and Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂcontactsÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â or family members. this was a big deal for me and i feel like this was entirely misrepresented. 

and while the claim of affordable could be debated, it feels a lot more like outright robbery when you consider you may not actually being offered anything for your payment except someone pretending they read your messages before sending an underwhelming response every day or two.

the worst part of this service is no one is there to help you navigate the process. i asked for some direction from all the different people i spoke to when getting matched up with a therapist and from the therapist themselves, but no one actually provided any. i was told Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂthereÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs no wrong way to do thisÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â and other nonsensical information that eventually left me getting match up with someone that evidently didnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât even want to help. from there no direction left me lost as to what to do. i tried just typing out things that i though might be helpful, but then i just felt ignored. i asked for specific things i could type in and was told Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âjust put as much or as little about anything you want.Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â there was never any progress. i basically felt worse all the time, knowing i chose the service and kept paying for it, but was never receiving any help.

i gave a great effort to try to make this service work for me, i continued using (and paying) for multiple months, but putting in all my effort is sometimes mentally and physically exhausting, and i felt like no one ever cared if i tried or not. by the end the therapist just stopped talking to me. my last live session was never schedule. i submitted feedback multiple times indicating i felt there was no progress (they have you fill out multiple surveys as you go), but those, too, seemed to have lost to the void of talkspace. if i didnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât feel worthless before i stated i surely did by the time i decided i needed to cancel. and even after completing the cancelation form explaining why i wanted to cancel, weeks before my paid time was over, still no contact from anyone. i guess when they find out you wonÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât be paying for future months no one has any interest in continuing to provide you the service youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve already paid for.

if youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âre really looking for some help, do your self a favor and just skip this app. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm sure that thereÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs some people that might find it helpful to just type out into the void, and get an Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âi hear youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â or Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂthatÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs too badÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â response once a day, five days a week, from someone that may or may not have read anything you typed, but if youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âre looking for anything else i donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât think youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âll find it in this app.

after sharing very personal information and feeling coned, they gave me a week credit and a new therapist. it took this person two days to read my pervious answers. i asked for a cancelation and refund day one, two, and three. their response two days later was that they have to pay their counselor for their time and i wouldn't be given a credit.. but boy oh boy! i get to talk to my therapist the rest of this month!

biggest issue right now is the policy disclosure says users can delete ""data"" but the button/feature is nowhere to be found.  it also doesn't state what happens to your account if you deactivate.
the consultant said to contact customer service for this type of info but in my opinion if you expect users (actual patients) to disclose such sensitive information this stuff needs to be wide open, within fingers reach, and documented in painstaking details.  
another big red flag is that they mentioned users can ""opt out"" of ads and services but there is no opt out checkbox anywhere.
additional questions :  will my conversations be analyzed for research, statistics, and advertising purposes?  if so how, how much, and with whom? how is data collected, stored, analyses, disseminated, utilized?
who is behind this app?  where can we check the credentials of therapists we get placed with? is there a rating system for therapists?

the response here asking for me to email them seems just for show, so they will appear as though they care about patients. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm strongly recommending other avenues for therapy. 

i had a meh therapist for three weeks. on the fourth week i asked to quit. the app suggested i try a free week with a new therapist. despite my clear unwillingness to discuss my situation with a male therapist, they shared my entire 3 weeks of therapy with a male therapist. and they charged me for another month during the final week.

change your therapist? sure! tried that. no response for days then a long message (longest one my therapist ever wrote by far) that did not sound like her asking me why and to help her understand why the change so she could be better in the future. are you kidding me?!?!

i also had issues where i somehow set up my account with an employers email i was leaving. i was horrified to realize my mistake and even more horrified when i realized there was no way to change it myself through the app or online. i contacted support. no response for days. the unsubscribe button on the bottom of their emails was a broken link. panicking as my last day approached and i would not have access to that address not to mention emails regarding my mental health were going to a non private address, i posted in my Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âtherapy roomÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â for help. finally got a response after contacting my cc company and reporting the service as a fraud but even then it took me replying several times unsubscribe and please stop emailing me here for them to actually stop and switch to my personal address. they just have so many automated messages they donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât seem to have control over when and where those messages get sent.

i reached out to my bank to dispute charges and only was able to get 1 refunded since the one in november was over 60 days old and the may one was pending. i reached out to talkspace about the and have yet to hear back.

1,"i would like to start by saying the app has been seriously helpful to me in the last two years. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve had leaps and bounds with stress management, better sleep and exercise. i will continue to use headspace going forward, as i appreciate itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs applications and it is now solidified into my routines. however, i will be continuing my use of headspace only through their website, as the app has a few problems that i have noticed as of late that i can no longer ignore. 

two years ago, i paid roughly $400 for the lifetime subscription, and after emailing the company i have confirmed this. i was unaware that the app itself does not support the lifetime subscription. i was charged last year for $100 during a very bad time and it set me back that month with expenses. to prevent having to pay that again, i switched to the 12.99 a month subscription plan this last year directly before i would have been charged again for my subscription. as many are aware, covid has affected nearly everyoneÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs hours at work and i am unable to afford this now. apple has refused a refund to me on the grounds that i paid for a yearly subscription (not true). as such, i will no longer be utilizing the app for my meditations and instead will be using only the web browser. 

the second issue i have been having a problem with is that no matter what i do the meditation or sleep sound will cut out after a few seconds, and refuses to play. this has gotten extremely frustrating. i have installed and uninstalled the app. i have had my phone looked at, i have tried it on my ipad. nothing. this is more than likely a programming issue, but i wonÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât be worrying about this after i delete this app. 

overall, itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs a good app. the meditations are helpful and itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs very easy to use. however, due to the expenses i have had to deal with for something that i paid for two years ago i will be deleting this from my phone. if or when they have the app supporting the subscription that i had paid for i will be more than happy to continue using the app, but at this time i must put it down.",5/15/2020 19:03,headspace,apple,email,,,0

the ios app has numerous bugs, crashes frequently(on my 5s), loads slowly, and requires restarts. stopping subscription requires an email to support - there is a functionality that looks like it allows you to do it yourself, but all it does is make you go through questionnaire with opportunities to freeze, downgrade, small one-time discount, but then it ends in a suspicious blank screen without confirmation of whether cancellation was successful or buttons to do anything about it.

1,"this app is ok, but not great. i think this mode of therapy has potential, but this company is doing it poorly. i worked with two therapists and didn't feel like they really tried to look at me as a whole person. 

given the cost of subscription, and the fact that they are licensed therapists, the therapists can't possibly devote very much time to each client, which isn't bad in and of itself, but it only leaves room for a small amount of attention.

i believe they work from a scripted method. which may be therapeutic to some people. but for me it didn't help at all after 3 months of messages every 3 days or so. if you just need someone to ask ""and how did that make you feel? and what do you think you should do about that?"", then this app might be for you. 

but!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
they won't cancel my subscription. they have a button that says ""cancel your subscription"" which takes you to a blank page that never loads. so i emailed their support, without reply. so i kept trying the cancel button, hoping they fixed it. i'm not using the service anymore which makes the cost every month a very big loss, for nothing.

1,"if youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve ever worked in sales you will recognize they use every trick in the book to get you to sign up. it seems pretty unethical for licensed therapists to be so manipulative to make a buck.

after determining they donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât take my insurance (or any insurance it seems, save for one plan), i wanted to forget my experience. and yet no one can tell me how to delete my account - and yes, talkspace, there is a difference between deleting an account and canceling a non-existent subscription.

their emails donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât even allow you to unsubscribe - the word Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂunsubscribeÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â is there but itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs not hyperlinked. ever heard of the can-spam act? though given your blatant disregard for ethics i guess i shouldnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât be surprised you donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât care about the law. 

do not waste your time with this app and whatever you do, do not enter any of your personal data into it.

to the developers:  dude.  really?  i used to be a programmer.  you must try your own app.  that was about 20 emails in a row!  one for each line!  i communicated less than 30 minutes with her.  20 e-mails in less than 30 minutes!?

be forewarned, unlimited texting means you can text whatever you want. but don't expect an answer. they only respond once or twice a day.

to make matters worse, they recently changed the layout of the home screen so when you open the app, you have to scroll past testimonials and information about juice cleanses to get to the course you are working through. why would a mindfulness app do this? it betrays a lack of commitment to the principles of mindfulness that headspace claims to care about. please just give me back my simple, uncluttered home screen and make it easy again to pick up where i left off rather than tempting me to use headspace the way i use facebook or pocket.",2/28/2020 12:07,headspace,apple,facebook,,,0

like everyone else stated below your therapist can get back to you at any interval, with the shortest possible response, and at any point in the day or night. i had a therapist text me at 1:45 in the morning to do breathing exercises?
i come from multiple different types of therapies. cbt, dbt, talk therapy, etc.
i personally matched with multiple therapist receiving almost the exact same response. 
Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âi understand, iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm sorry. letÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs do some breathing exercises.Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â
i am not discrediting breathing exercises or the practice of cbt. i find it can be very helpful. 
the problem though is that it needs to be paired with something that even sounds remotely like they read or listened to what you were saying. 
talking about the death of a loved one or other large life events being met with an Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âi understand, iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm sorry.Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â to me personally seems so detached from the patient and their experience. 
i find this to be a way to shove a large amount of people seeking real help to one therapist who sends out a slightly edited text.

1,"first of all, you have to pay for a month up front. no therapy works like that. and there is no justification for it at all. 

second, they promise you way more time with a therapist than you actually get. you should only be charged for the time you get but if they did that then in reality they could only charge you $10 a month instead of the $130 they cheat you out of.

the first therapist i had barely communicated, and when i did get a response it was extremely generic. after almost two days and not hearing anything, i asked to change. it took them two days to do that. there are 4 days that i paid for with nothing happening. they changed me to cynthia who did not even check in with me until almost 10pm the following day after she was assigned. there went another day i paid for and received no services. then she informed me that she would only check in once a day, and i was promised twice when i signed up, and it would be at night. again, i was switched. the ""therapist matcher"", jennifer, came back in the room and i told her i was being cheated out of money and she completely ignored me. that's why they charge up front and don't give refunds. how can they feel okay with cheating people seeking therapy out of their money? 

i was finally put with someone who i liked but the pattern starts all over. they spend time with you at the beginning but then you are lucky if you get 10 minutes a day out of them. and it's always very early in the morning and late at night because otherwise they are in their private practices. 

i definitely do not recommend this for someone who needs undivided attention, has anxiety or depression because your therapist will leave you in mid-conversation for at least 6 to 8 hours at a time. then when they do come back you're lucky if you get five minutes with them before they leave again.

there is no substitute for real therapy.

1,"i signed up for talkspace at the beginning of november of 2020 after realizing i needed to seek counseling for my general anxiety and severe insecurity and social anxiety. like most people who struggle with these things, particularly social anxiety, it took a great deal of courage to take the step to get help, especially because i had never been through therapy before due to cost and extreme hesitancy to reach out for professional help. this is something i mentioned repeatedly to my therapist and the matching representative throughout my brief time with talkspace. 

i was assigned to a therapist named lisa within a day or two of signing up with talkspace. i was very open with my deep sense of imposter syndrome and social anxiety and though i wasnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât in immediate peril, it was really important for me to talk to someone so i could regain control of my life. it was going fine until i received a notification that my therapist would be on vacation until the end of december. at this point, it was around november 8, and iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âd used talkspace for less than a week. neither lisa nor talkspace gave me any prior notification that she would be gone or gave me a substituteÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âor, assigned me to a therapist who didnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât have a month and a half vacation planned. instead, the automated notification in my chat with lisa said i was encouraged to keep sending messages to her so i could write down my feelings and sheÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âd get back to me when she returned from vacation. yes, talkspace expected me to continue paying the fee for a month and a half while i message myself in an echo chamber. especially as a person who struggles with self image and feeling valued by othersÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âwhich, again, i made very clear to everyone at talkspace i talked withÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âthis was a massive blow and completely undid what little therapy lisa had provided me. 

i emailed talkspace explaining the situation in detail, how horrible it made me feel, how irresponsible both talkspace and lisa were, and asking for a refund. i received a very sterile automated response telling me to fill out a form so i could get my refund, and everything i had written about my displeasure with my experience fell completely on deaf ears. i felt so insignificant, which was intensified by the fact that it was a therapy service that supposedly made counseling affordable, accessible, and empowering. it did none of those things for me. 

i had very high hopes for talkspace and thought i was doing myself good by accepting that i needed help, but all i received in return was invalidation and a complete distrust of therapy.",1/4/2021 19:53,talkspace,apple,security,,,0

1,"pre-recorded waffle, this app is probably better when paid for but as such when regarding health (especially) mental health you need to be aware that this app is here to make money and that is the bottom line. i don't doubt some may have found these methods to be helpful in some way but perhaps seeking a medical professional would be better, someone motivated by results not profit. the app uses careful dialogue to lead you into a false sense of selfless security and sincerity.",3/5/2019 15:42,headspace,google,security,,,0

1,login mechanism is ridiculously complex. why do i need such complex security to listen to meditation tapes? why doesn't it remember my password? not exactly conducive to calm and relaxation.  :-p  i'm not jumping through hoops for you.  there are plenty of other meditation apps.,9/17/2017 13:57,headspace,google,security,,,0
1,i'm uninstalling. i thought this app was free. i guess getting help for mental health & meditation is never free. it's sad that i'm on medicaid due to having to stop working because of multiple sclerosis & its not covered. whatever. i'll keep on keeping on by myself. isolated from the world by covid & not getting help from social security even though i can't walk with out falling & can't work; my brain sucks. so i'm on assistance. i'm not going to kill myself but many others probably would.,12/23/2020 5:32,sanvello,google,security,,,0
1,"why do i have to re-enter my e-mail and password every time i want to use the app if there's already a separate password to open it? for security reasons? even apps that work with your money (like paypal) don't ask you to do that. oh well. it's pretty much useless anyway if you want to improve your mental health. they claim it's for tracking your progress or whatever, but even that is behind a paywall. wanna track more than three basic habits (like sleeping and eating)? pay us! uninstalled.",12/21/2019 21:22,sanvello,google,security,,,0

1,"$15 per month, $70 per year, $500 for a Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂlifetimeÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â. for those of us that are under constant stress due to being disabled or otherwise ill, these are meals, medications, survival. i assume the content is being refreshed from costly sources. for those i know that get $700 a month from social security disability or evening those of us that get a whopping $2200 a month yet support several other people with no consideration from the government we stretch every penny to stay alive and in a home. itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs nice to see development of apps to help but this one is far out of reach for Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âthe rest of usÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â.",11/19/2019 21:13,calm,apple,social security,security,,0
