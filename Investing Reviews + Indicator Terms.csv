my response to you not storing my bank info, your app asks for my Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âlogin infoÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â and gives no option to manually setup my routing information (ios.) it doesnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât matter if you store it or not, your app bottlenecks me into compromising my login credentials in order to move forward. no thanks and again, i found out my bank offers similar service. so, regardless if you store it or not, you canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât guarantee the user that your company does not store our bank login credentials nor can you guarantee that information wonÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât be compromised. finish terminating my account, please. you are currently at 2 days since requested to do so.",robinhood,bank login,,,,1

-easy to use

cons:

overall unimpressed with the app. i thought the no fees were to good to be true and that is the case. you are better off using fidelity or really any other brokerage account. itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs not worth having your info sold or even the possibility of restrictive trading. especially when the market is volatile and you want to buy or sell quickly.

1,"i have been trying to use personal capitol for a year. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve also tried  to work with their support to fix the issues but they failed.
bank account information synced up ok but my credit cards did not. the concept is good but if your accounts do not all sync up, it doesnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât tell your entire financial situation. 
for the past year, personal capitol support kept telling me Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â we are working on itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â.
my accounts are with the well known institutions so iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm not sure what the issues are. 
after a year of trying it out i finally gave up.

before i downloaded this app i read the reviews online and at the app store and although a few reports of awful customer service caught my attention i figure that these might be outliers and i should at least set up an account and give it a try.

so i downloaded it, installed and allow them to link to my savings account and then came the part about verifying my identity my taking a copy of my id and for some reason the application was unable to scan it.  after multiple tries i opened a ticket, but didnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât heard from them until i got an email four days later with a link to a website where i could load a picture of my id.

wrote to the support staff with a list of issues and they apparently did little or nothing. received a sales call from the company. i advised them that i could not use their services because i could not access very much information. told him how much i wanted to like the company and he said he would see what he could do. after that i received a couple of e-mails asking for copies of financial data to see if they could fix things and explanations of why they could not access other data. 

using insecure e-mail to provide them with my private financial information is not acceptable.

i don't care if this is the apple store, strangers should not be asking for copies of my id. combine that with they already had my bank info and what kind of idiot would i need to be to give them any more info.

now, after 4 weeks of waiting i finally got some sort of update on my account that asked me for more information (a picture of my drivers license and a passports) but still that isnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt enough and it also wants a picture of my ssn card which i do not have and never received. i have also never needed this to open any bank accounts so why is it that robinhood needs this? is the other identification not enough? i have sent many emails but the customer service is terrible.

even if it is my fault, and i should have an ssn card, why have they held out on this information for a month?? was it that hard to ask for this information when signing up, that way i dinÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt have pour a month of my time into trying to get this stupid app to work?

edit of my last review. first iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âll explain the outcome. millions of people lost thousands of dollars on 01/29/2021 when robinhood manipulated the markets for the most held stocks and made them crash. the how is that  they didnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât allow buying of gamestop stock and amc and others that were surging, but still allowed selling. if it can only be sold and not bought by the small investors, the big guys buy it back for cheep, and the price tanks. evil stuff this app did. it looks like the reason is because some of robinhoods biggest investors are thos hedge funds that were getting hurt. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm removing my money and deleting the app.",robinhood,bank statement,,,,0

so, my friend and i saw an acorn ad on instagram, i think, and we both signed up. be aware, when you create an account and link your bank, you automatically sign up for their minimum monthly plan. i had no idea! after on month, i realized iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm not interested in this app, so i unlinked my bank account. i thought this would stop any transactions from happening. false! months later i discovered that theyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve been charging me monthly fees. i couldnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât understand as i was sure i unlinked my bank account. after looking through their application, under settings i found subscriptions tab and here it was, my membership which i had no idea about. 

this is a sneaky tactic as iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm sure there are thousands of people who think that they unliked their bank account without realizing that they are continuously being charged monthly fees. granted, itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs only one dollar but i have a feeling this was purposely planned so that people donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât notice those small charges on their bank statements. 

itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs been three days since iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm trying to cancel this membership. i havenÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât been able to do it because it says i have pending transactions. what transactions? iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm so frustrated, iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm giving them until tomorrow to clear this pending bs, otherwise iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âll contact my bank and file a complaint with better business bureau.",acorn,bank statement,,,,0
2,"frauds with horrible customer service. save yourself a headache & use different app! locked my acct with hundreds of $ for months. claimed they had to verify bank acct was still open. claimed couldnt use bank acct til i sent them a statement. yet they quickly withdrew $ from the very bank acct they claimed they couldn't use until verified, to fund stash debit card. despite it clearing they still refused to unlock stash account. i reluctantly sent bank statement. acct stayed locked 2 more months.",stash,bank statement,,,,0
1,"frequency of direct deposit pop ups, uncertainty of at what price stock will be bought, and long transfer time make this app very frustrating. and this is just the average experience, what happened to me is insane: soon after opening by debit account and depositing $500, stash inexplicably blocked it. for 2 weeks i've been requesting support to have the account unlocked and get my money back. after uploading all the additional files they requested, including id and bank statements, they answered i should call green dot corporation. in the call they said this block comes from loss prevention so there is nothing they can do. if i want my money back, i can try contacting my bank from where the funds came and request canceling that transaction. i never though something like this could be possible. all i wanted was to try investing with this app and now i'm spending all this time trying to get my money back.",stash,bank statement,,,,0
1,"good luck with this. i have been trying to perform the very (deceptively) simple process of changing the finding source. multiple uploads of bank documents, zero response (even in reply to company sent follow up emails) from customer service usually resulting to having to write something on twitter. it says something when a companies social media team is quicker to act than the customer service team. still cannot change funding source as, once again, it wants me to send the same previously sent bank statement to prove my previously used funding source. isnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât that what passwords are for? frustrating and not worth it for a micro investing site. go elsewhere.",acorn,bank statement,,,,0
1,got charged too many times. they said to verify the small two amounts in order to withdraw. the small two amounts does not show on my bank statement.  then i emailed customer service twice. they don't respond.  they still don't help you. i got $400 saved in there and why would you need to verify two small amounts that's not even on the statement to get to your money?,acorn,bank statement,,,,0

1,"heard about this app from a referral. wanted to see about getting the free stock. according to the person who referred me, it took him about a day to get his free sprint stock. i proceeded to sign up and was waiting to be verified for two days. on the third day, i contacted support. it took support 2 days to respond. they said i needed to send a photo of my bank statement with my address for verification. i did so. but still i received no free stock. i contacted robinhood again and they replied a day later saying they needed the pdf version of my bank statement instead. so i did just that. still, i was only 67% verified. i contacted them again and they asked me to go through their photo uploading system and send a photo of my bank statement. this was getting a little ridiculous at this point but i did so. still... no change, no free stock. i sent an email to their support asking what the delay was. they told me my apartment address was not a residential address... after all this time, that was the issue? iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm not sure why they donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât recognize my apartment complex as a residential address, but their support team gave me no other options. they were not willing to call the complex to verify my information and/or support did not offer for me to speak to someone higher up to fix this matter. the majority of the replies throughout this entire experience seemed automated and redundant. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve dealt with really great support teams with other apps. dealing with robinhood support team just feels like youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âre dealing with a robot.. very impersonal and very delayed responses.",robinhood,bank statement,,,,0

1,"horrible app. terrible ui. disgustingly rude and unprofessional customer 
service team. all you get is generic-robo-responses and run around. they 
claim my bank ""charged back"" my deposits, and that no money was ever taken 
from my account. despite the fact i can see it on my bank statement. they 
were constantly delinking my bank account, it claims, a few transactions 
were declined: despite having more than enough money to cover the total 
cost of each individual transaction. which resulted in me having to relink 
the accounts each time. my bank has no clue what acorns is talking about in 
regards to the ""chargebacks,"" and before that, acorns at first claimed they 
sent my withdrawal money to my bank account. but once i questioned its 
whereabouts, since it was never deposited, the story changed. now acorns 
claimed they never took any money in the first place, and show a negative 
balance in my stock account. so they basically stole my money, and are now 
claiming i owe them even more. don't waste your time or hard earned money

since i hadnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât heard anything back in that given time iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve attended teaching customer support several times to ask what else is needed to proceed with the process. no response from their end to the many attempts on my part.",robinhood,bank statement,,,,0

1,"i have been interested in getting into investing and this app was recommended from a trusted friend who has been able to invest positively at her comfort level. with an abundance of companyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs out there to choose from i decided to go with this one as i had a personal recommendation. 

almost a month ago i downloaded the app and attempted to start investing. i thought that once i linked my bank account i would be able to start investing right away, but this was not the case, instead i was told i need to take a picture of my bank statement for verification purposes. because i handle my affairs paperlessly i did not have a statement i could take a picture of and this company offered no other option for submitting the document. as a result i pulled up my virtual statement on one devise and took a picture with another and submitted. it then told me that it takes 5-7 days for the company to review my bank statement and approve my account. after 7 day i received an email notice that what i sent was insufficient and that i still needed to complete this step. 

i replied to the email explaining my problem and they replied for me to use a portal to upload my documents; however, i could not locate such portal. i then went to the bank to obtain a copy of my statement and took a picture the exact way they requested and waited another 7 days for them to reply to me. my result was the same as before (my document was insufficient. i replied to that email my frustration to which i received a reply that the issue is that the address on my statement was not a residential address i asked if it would be sufficient if i sent a copy of my state issued id with the matching address which they said would be suffice. i took a picture of my id in their system and sent a copy by email and waited another 7 days only to receive the same response.  i am now no longer interested in using this app as it should not be this difficult to enroll. i am going to continue my search for an investment app that is easy to use secure and will allow me to invest positively.",robinhood,bank statement,,,,0
1,"i have been locked out of my account. the customer service representative informed me the only way to access my account,  is to send them a screen shot of my bank account (which would include my balance and my bank statements/history). 
evidently this is the only acceptable way for their business to confirm my identity...and itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âfor my securityÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â (lol). according to them, an attempt was made to transfer a large amount of money to my account and they need to make sure it was me (if it was large enough to be suspicious i donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât think it was, unless i made a mistake). not sure why i should feel threatened by money going in my account? unless it was part of a plot to get my bank statements and all my bank info...
 this protocol is treating customers like criminals Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âfor their securityÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â.  itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs very suspicious and most certainly not the safest or most ethical way it could be handled. the only way to contact anyone to resolve any issue is through automated emails, or call centers. everyone has strong foreign accents, very difficult to understand. 
there are no managers reachable through call centers.  Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂsorryÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âi understand how you feelÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂthatÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs all i can doÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â weÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âre the only responses i got from them. as of now it seems my options are:
 a) lose my money to acorns
 or 
b) give up all my info and maybe get my money, but definitely have to open a new bank account and transfer all my funds first, then close that one after and just hope my identity will be safe. 
there are plenty of ways i can prove my identity which i would appreciate and understand and comply with. this is a no for me. i strongly regret investing with acorn!! highly recommend not doing business with them.

****update****
the suspicious Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âlarge amountÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â turned out to be $100, which was in fact me. i had moved and my address was not updated so it caused some confusion i guess. 
after a bbb complaint, a month or so of a huge hassle: 
responding to emails several times and being sent the same automated email over and over, claiming i didnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât respond; 
attempts to close my complaint ticket with the bbb claiming they have not been able to reach me; 
wasted time calling and being hung up on and having to call and wait fo get through again...
and this issue was finally resolved. i was contacted by a real person i could understand and he was able to confirm my identity the right way and get my account closed Ã£Â°Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂÃ¢Â iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm opening the champagne now, cheers!! 
little piece of advice if this happens to anyone else, >if you try to respond to acorns emails, **make sure it gets sent and doesnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât go to your drafts. mine didnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât work until i stopped using Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂreplyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â and typed a new email and the email address. somehow my email wouldn't recognize the recipient until i did that... Ã£Â°Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â¤Ã¢Â

as long as my money is returned to my account in the 3-4 business days promised i will be grateful. 

******my biggest suggestion to acorn is to use an authentication app or something else from now on, to make this a much easier issue to deal with for acorns and those who still support them. i believe businesses that focus more on what they have to offer people than they do on their profits, will consequently be more profitable and sustainable. ****** 

in conclusion, i am very relieved and grateful to acorns for choosing to return my money in a practical and ethical way and i hope to see them grow and evolve from these issues. i believe this business could be great for everyone involved. best of luck!!",acorn,bank statement,,,,0

do not invest with stash!! you will see a reply shortly by stash asking me to email or call....like they are concerned. if youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âre so concerned answer either of the two emails iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve already sent this week.",stash,bank statement,,,,0

 i left a bad review about this issue so they took off the Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂpendingÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â $50 but never put the $50 back in my account! they kept my disability money and i donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât get another check for two weeks. how am i going to do anything with less than $10? i am beyond livid! and there is no running total. so you canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât see what you have until the end of the month bank statement. this bank is shady. when i called they continued to transfer me to Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âsomeone who could helpÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â and each transfer was a 20 minute hold time. stay away!!!

i have messaged regarding my account but it takes close to a week, even longer, to get a response. i used this account to pay for instacart and they have held $50 for a week now, in addition to processing the $45 order, so iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm broke. the only, and i do mean only, good thing about stash is that my direct deposit goes through early. but i canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât deposit checks, i canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât have checks, and the transfers between bank accounts takes forever.",stash,bank statement,,,,0
1,"i logged onto robinhood a month or so ago hoping to invest, learn, and grow as an investor. i transferred several deposits early and was trading about $1200. over that month i decided to slowly dump more cash for trading into my robinhood account. on 10/14/2020 i deposited $1000. two days later i noticed two separate transactions of $1000 each was pulled from my banking account. when i reached out to robinhood they insist i initiated two separate transactions within 20 seconds of each other. now that is just silly. who would do that and why. regardless, i am 100% certain that i did not initiate two transactions of $1000 each within 20 seconds. it may have a been a glitch. idk. thankfully i have the money not only to cover the transactions but to also cover my cash needs in the 12 days it would take to get my money back. what is most concerning is customer services insistence that (a) itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs not a big deal, (b) eventually my account will receive the $2000 and i can just transfer back if i need/want to. (c) there is no way it could be a glitch, but i must have gotten sudden short-term memory loss and not realized i pressed deposit four times to make two transfers. 

too add insult to injury they asked me to send them a pdf of my bank statement making sure i include my first and last name, my address, my bank name, my account type, and my account number.... i am not sure why they didnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât just ask for my pin too! how is a pdf of my bank statement that includes all that info help them investigate a double transfer that took place on their tech! how??

i was really liking robinhood but i am not sure i can trust their team or their product any longer.

 the representative replied my email while i was on the call with him, in the email, the rep specified that i had to prove my bank account by reaching out to my bank for bank statements. i explained that i had an issue with my bank and the bank account number that i was using to invest on stash got changed by my bank because of security reasons,  but i will get the required documentation to prove it is my bank account.

i replied the email with the required information. then,  i called in again to inform them that i had sent the required information. the rep put me on hold to look at the documents and after 3 minutes, she got back to me and said, some other department will reach out by email. i asked if the dept could help me unlink my old account number and link a new one. she said i had to call back after i got the email from the mystery department. the call with the rep was 5 hours ago and still no email from the mystery department. 

then i said to myself, this is the reason why robinhood has better reviews than stash. stash is a piece of crap as per customer service and is not that the app is even that great.  what does stash do awesomely? i asked myself. i know, they donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât have problems withdrawing your money. thatÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs what they do awesomely.

1,"it will have you excited to buy portions of stocks and you can (in real time) check the amount your stocks have risen or decreased. it is an awesome app but there is a catch. in order to sell your stock it is an absolute hassle. it seems easy but when you sell it it takes quite an extensive amount of time to get the money in your buying power. once itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs there the real hassle begins... trying to transfer your own money to your bank account. i have tried for the past 2 days trying to get my money into my bank through this app and it just sits there and loads for no reason! and conveniently, itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs only this app that does this. please let me get my money out of this account so i can close it and leave yÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âall alone. also another thing happened that i will be contacting a lawyer about... i bought 50 dollars worth of a stock that was in my portfolio for a week. then it disappeared and with bank statements to prove it you guys are an absolute scam and you will have to pay for this.",stash,bank statement,,,,0
1,"itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs impossible to link my bank to fidelity, even though i put my correct information in which is more than enough. they have unreasonable demands Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â you must show a voided check, deposit slip with your name and account printed on it, or a bank statement. i just opened my bank a few weeks ago, and i get estatements. i donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât have checks. the deposit slips donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât list my name. so what, i canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât use fidelity?

you need to catch up to other brokers with concerns to linking bank accounts. use test deposits or something. and then to say itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs an additional 4 to 7 business days to process if iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm ever even able to link my bank Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â unacceptable. 

giving 1 star because the app is decent albeit very cluttered and bloated. use robinhoodÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs classy ui as inspiration for the future please (this goes for other bad uis like td, etrade, etc as well). i have a feeling iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âd like fidelity if i was ever able to use it, unfortunately the severe opportunity cost makes fidelity a hard pass.",fidelity,bank statement,,,,0

i signed up. attached account number. authorized a $50k transfer. it keeps asking for bank statement with address. sent it thru app (canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât upload, only picture). it asked to take another shot. printed out again, different angle. nope. tried closer up. nope. 4 times. and they donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât tell you for hours to retake it. no idea why it doesnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât work. but, this is probably automated with ai and machine learning. if this is a problem at this level, what is wrong with their other coding and system. so honestly, before i give a company $100kÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs of money and investments...if they canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât get the basic stuff at this point, i canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât trust you.

1,so if your banking account changes you have to send a bank statement to verify who you are. you canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât just link another account to verify your identity because for some reason that isnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât allowed. instead they will just hold your money until you get them a bank statement. this feels like terrible policy to hijack someoneÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs money until they jump through hoops to get it sorted out. i have been with stash for well over two years and suddenly they canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât be bothered to help unlock an account i have been adding money to for quite a while. wouldnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât recommend which is unfortunate because up until this happened i would have wholeheartedly recommended them.,stash,bank statement,,,,0
2,"so many problems recently: 

(1) i canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât verify my bank account in acorns because the micro-deposits never showed up, thereÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs apparently no way to restart the verification process, and i canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât remove my bank account from acorns because my bank doesnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât include full account numbers on statements and i donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât have checks for my checking account (acorns requires a photo of your bank statement or a voided check to remove your bank account).

(2) you canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât get an acorns spend account (their high interest checking account) without also paying for an acorns later account (a retirement account). i donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât need another retirement account.

(3) for some reason acorns failed to be able to Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âverify the necessary information to open an acorns spend account forÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â me. betterment, robinhood, tastyworks, and tradestation, all had no trouble verifying my information and opening my accounts. also there is no option to double check my information and try again. if i try to downgrade my account and then upgrade again to get an acorns spend account i get the warning, Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âif you close your acorns spend account, you wonÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât be able to reopen it or get a new one.Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â

(4) there is no way to call or even email acorns for support. the only way to contact acorns is through a form on their support site. most companies nowadays annoyingly donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât provide phone support, but i wanted to at least email them. i had taken some screenshots of many of these problems so that i could refer to them in my email in order to save time by not having to write a complete explanation for every problem. then i learned about the contact form and no published email address. you canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât attach screenshots with their support form so iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm stuck wasting time typing out paragraphs of explanations  of these problems. thatÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs when i decided that if i have to spend too much time writing a long email and since theyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âre making everything so difficult, i would share my problems with their app publicly as a review here instead of through their web form to save other people the trouble. 

(5) many other people have complained about the excessive time it takes (3-6 days) to withdraw funds from acorns. (i wouldnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât know because i canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât even verify my bank account with them, but if this is true then they are the slowest of any investment service/app iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve ever used.)

 i would not recommend this app to anyone i care about, but maybe to my enemies. anyway, iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm off to look for a different app/service to automatically invest my spare-change/round-ups.",acorn,bank statement,,,,0
1,so my account has been locked for 3+ months and you ppl have done nothing to resolve the issue! this is after sending my bank statement  to you all!! terrible customer service!!,stash,bank statement,,,,0
1,so robinhood has a great product on the surface. where they fail miserably is they allow you to join and then while you are trading or sometimes have an open position youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âre fixing to close by end of day they slam the account.  they freeze everything including closing option positions and there is nobody home there. it takes 1-3 business days for a response meanwhile they have your account hijacked and if youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve made money in the way beginning beware. they flag those accounts and freeze your capital gains while asking for pedigree information like a bank statement (meanwhile youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve verified your account already ) and photo id (which has already been sent to them when you opened the account ),robinhood,bank statement,,,,0
1,"so robinhood support is a joke, if you have a real issue they wonÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât respond fast so have fun trying,

then i test something, i made a new email for fun, i message support, i got 6 messages in 3 days, but only 1 message in a month period from my account, so iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm guessing they donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât want to do their job and just leave me hanging? some customer support i tell you",robinhood,bank statement,,,,0

1,taking my money out of the account was impossible because i change my funding source they wanted my bank statement which i provided and didnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât accepted it because they wanted in the statement the full account number and now has been taking over a month trying to receive my money and still not received it. i had other accounts and this was has been the only one that makes it impossible taking youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âre money out.,acorn,bank statement,,,,0
1,terrible app. wont let me login due to bank statements. ridiculous.,robinhood,bank statement,,,,0
1,"terrible customer service. account is locked and they won't let me access my funds, or the app. they require that i send them copies of my bank statements to ensure that i own the account. they have no trouble taking their fee out of my account each month though. who knows what they are doing with my personal banking information. they never called me to confirm the account, they just lock you out and hold your money hostage.",acorn,bank statement,,,,0
1,"the app is awful and somewhat confusing to use. donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât even think about changing banks. they will lock your account and accuse you of uploading fake bank statements when you want to unlock it. customer service is rude. beyond rude. i requested getting my money back but i highly doubt iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âll see that money. be careful changing banks, you too will lose all money put in. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm pretty certain that these 5 stars are people who work at stash, fake emails made up just to write a review and employees friends and family. garbage. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âd give stash a negative number if i couldnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât. zero stars isnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât even good enough for this place.",stash,bank statement,,,,0

1,"the first week went well, i made sure there was money in my bank, second week i had over $500 of investments then robinhood reverses my account and says i owe over $300. i checked my bank statement they 8 transactions and on robinhood only shows 5. i emailed a person and a person name emely replied and told to talk to my bank. then few minutes later the 2 more transaction showed after the reversal. so this does not make sense to me. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm not really happy with this.",robinhood,bank statement,,,,0
1,"the process of linking a new bank account is insane. why do i need to upload a picture of a bank statement? ok, i made a screenshot of my last statement and uploaded it but later noticed that thereÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs no account number on the screenshot! now, what? i need to wait 4-7 business day (aka forever) for my request to be denied and then link again and wait again? why canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât i re-upload it? if i try to link the same account again it gives me an error. this is ridiculous. i donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât understand who these Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂsecurityÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â measures are protecting but definitely not me.",fidelity,bank statement,,,,0
1,"-the process of withdrawing and depositing takes forever and glitches out any bank statement, confusing you

-doesnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât work when you most need it, you could lose thousands of dollars from options trading if robinhood decides to freeze on you (yes, someone out there actually lost $773,000 on the freeze the first week of march)

-their terms and condition states that under any circumstance, if you lose money due to their technical problems, itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs not their fault. no compensation or coverage

-no other stock brokerage does this. i suggest moving to tastyworks, tos, or webull. they may have small commission, but youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âd rather deal with $0.65 commission rather than lose hundreds in the matter of minutes because this app freezes, right?",robinhood,bank statement,,,,0
2,"there is only an email to contact support, they do not read your email. instead, they send generic messages for guidance. ensure the funds are in the same acct or savings they connected you to. for some reason i was charged 130$ in ach fees for insufficient funds but both accounts had plenty of money and robinhood refuses to reimburse despite multiple attempts and screen shots of my bank statements.",robinhood,bank statement,,,,0

1,they charge a monthly fee. i signed up and didn't realize that at all then was surprised when i saw on my bank statement their monthly fee. i don't recall them having that on the sign up page but if i'm mistaken then i'm wrong. the app should be free. make money on ads or something else instead. i would instead recommend auto investing with vanguard. you can auto invest weekly any amount and just forget about it and it will grow over time. or auto invest with an online money market account.,acorn,bank statement,,,,0
1,they deactivated my account so i followed their instructions. went to the bank for the statement because you guys told me to. posted my id and bank statement and you guys seem like you didnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât even look at it. and my id wasnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât even expired are you guys freakin blind?,robinhood,bank statement,,,,0

1,they have made it incredibly difficult to set up an account and have required multiple methods of proof of identity and address verification. no one i know has had to send images of their social security card and bank statements and utility bills. they have not returned any of my efforts to reach out to clarify information and answer my questions. do not use; find another way to invest.,robinhood,bank statement,,,,0

1,this app is so bad im taking the time to write a review they charged me a fee when i had put a new card on file. because the previous card was deactivated between a transaction but i had a new card on file immediately the system couldn't see that. they charged me 30$ fee i contacted them and they told me to send them pictures of my id and my card i did. then i got no response i kept contacting them to find out they wouldn't refund me and were asking me for photos of my bank statement i sent but they would not refund me. terrible customer service they did not refund me anything and on top of that they blocked my account.,robinhood,bank statement,,,,0

1,this company is trash. should have listened to all the reviews. they have you link your bank account through plaid. where they can see your bank info. but still make you send in bank statements as proof. you literally have all of my bank info through plaid. i work with it professionally on a daily basis so dont tell me you dont. you also have my driver license and everything else. its my damn bank account. its my damn plaid info. its my damn driver license. what else can i do to prove its me?,robinhood,bank statement,,,,0
1,this has by far been the worst banking experience iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve ever had. if i could close my account i would but i canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât actually access my money. i closed my bank account that was previously linked to acorns and have tried repeatedly to link a new account. they said it canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât be verified unless i enter the micro deposit amounts. but no deposits have been made to my account. now my spend account is overdrafted and they wonÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât let me deposit to the account because my source still canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât be verified. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve provided them with multiple bank statements. i keep getting emails saying iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm going to be turned over to collections but when i call the help line they canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât help me deposit money into it. i also canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât close my accounts and withdraw the money in my investment accounts because they wonÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât verify my bank information. i asked if they would transfer directly from my investment account to my spend account and they said thatÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs not possible. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âd first have to withdraw it (which i canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât do) and then deposit it (which i also canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât do). iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve tried repeatedly to remedy this situation and if i get turned over to collections i will be looking into my possible legal options. this is beyond ridiculous.,acorn,bank statement,,,,0

1,to glitchy. i downloaded the app tried to create an account. it would get stuck on certain steps. so i went to the website to continue. they asked for a copy of my bank statement to verify my residential address but thats not going to work because my statements have my mailing address and not my residential address. so the account probably wont get approved which is fine. after seeing how glitchy the website and app are i dont want an account. glad i couldnt fund it due to glitchness.,robinhood,bank statement,,,,0

1,"while i have appreciated the app for its investment capabilities as well as using it as reference tool when considering investing in other companies, products, commodities, etc i have had the worst experience with their customer service. meaning i have received no customer service support. 

i have reached out to stash customer service multiple times now about:

1. a purchase and sale of an investment that i didnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât make that showed up on my account. the investment is still there, because iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm waiting to hear from someone to correct this situation. this is hugely concerning! how did this happen? a data breach? a random weird accident? iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âd like to understand and i canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât do that without their help. yet...crickets, meaning no response.

2. i have an automatic weekly investment amount that is withdrawn from my account each week and it was withdrawn twice in one week. i was again very concerned about this and reached out to stash customer service and never received any help in resolving the situation. i instead double and triple checked that my weekly auto withdraw was the amount and frequency i wanted and then checked my bank statements over the next few weeks and what i learned from weekly reviews is that sometimes the weekly auto amount is taken out at the beginning of the following week and can overlap with that weeks auto withdraw. i spent weeks stressing about this and trying to make sure that the amount and frequency wasnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât going to randomly change for reasons that were not clear to me on my end. a customer service person could have explained this to me in one response, rather than me having to spend weeks stressing and watching for patterns. 

i am giving the app 1 star because customer service is incredibly important. stash is taking our money...our money and if stash isnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât willing or capable of being responsive to our concerns about our money and investments (this is all the app does) in private and then we have to make our collective experiences known in other places. 

i have the stash Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂacknowledgmentÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â emails recording the successful submission my concerns, but no reply or engagement by a customer service representative follows. 

again to be clear the app itself is useful, but i am very concerned by the lack of communication and support that iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve made multiple efforts to receive. it makes me lack confidence in the company and the safety of my information, money and investments.

i wish it was all rainbows and cupcakes, but this has been my honest experience.",stash,bank statement,,,,0

1,"i had this set at 5 stars bc i thought it was but itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs -1!  i purchased the $9 monthly subscription. incrementally across a month, i took about $5000 and invested. i used money from my 401k retirement and profits from employee stock purchase plan to do this. in just a few short months, my account was nearly $15,000. i was generally selling and reinvesting based on my own little strange path to determining which stock was on break out with percentage. i had reached a level that simply reinvesting was growing my account without adding additional funds. so in the last 30 days, i had stopped adding and started being able to both reinvest as well as use some of profits for other things in my life while still increasing. at the time this occurs (2 days ago) i not only get a message that thereÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs a reversal but that my account is locked. i knew i had not requested a deposit, nor was there any reason for stash not to receive funding as i had money in both the banking app and investment app. upon calling i hear that basically the clearing house apex demands my account closed and liquidated. why? because they can snd donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât have to tell me. 
they refuse to transfer my stocks to fidelity, e-trade, ameritrade - one of the reputable platforms, which means my tax bracket on capital gains will break me next year. they tell me that they will send email identifying the timeline. all the while they were already liquidating. they continually said we are doing this ok? i continually answered Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âno it is not okÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â in the moment i knew immediately it was because of my returns and positions with certain stock. upon downloading documents i began to notice certain receipts missing showing my positions - positions that brought returns at 60% in certain stocks, you see to send those to another firm was a very lucrative thing for quite some time. however, iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm sure someone on the other side had plans for my positions but at this point i havenÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât connected the pieces. 

so i then begin to learn what form 13 is and how itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs required. this still doesnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât necessarily mean anything until i figure out how the relationships work. you see apex is a clearing firm. number 1: they donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât generally hold stock except that in settlement. well selling mine aug 27 puts it in their firm Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âso accidentallyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â on the 31st when i had two stock in full share amounts that are not only splitting but anticipated to increase by 33%. you say why not just purchase for themselves? because if you werenÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât in before a certain date, you donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât get the multiplication. they did this on thursday so that the exact settlement fell into their hands while they still hold all of my funds as well. again, because we can and we donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât have to tell you - yet timing is uncanny and a little transparent when i take this further. based on this, what does it profit long term, apex has to relinquish it, or do they? 

turns out apex is owned by another company with a very special privaledge awarded from sec several years prior. this parent company is called peak6 investments. wow! there it is! an investment company hiding at the top with special privaledge for the clearing house (apex) to hold their investments. so apex can hold the stocks after all bc technically everything sold becomes potential derivative of peak6. now i do the math. letÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs suppose this occurs on all small accounts with this specific stock and they gain 20,000 shares. the 20,000 increases on monday to 100,000. the value of this 100,000 is somewhere near $50m. now add the potential boost up to 30% = another $15m. 
so $65m they leveraged (racketeered) from anyone who had this with right position that they felt didnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât make earn enough income to do anything about it. this includes all our minority and immigrant populations as well as those who work in positions that shouldnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât be able to understand or discover the pattern. however, stash is greed for the beginners and population who have difficulty having the same advantage. yet you see, let us find the advantage, they will steel it Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âbc they canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â they say. 

now letÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs add insult to injury. i not only had the one stock that will split monday, i had the two stock that will split monday. on top of that, my portfolio contained 3 more stocks that are set to split before years end. finally, my portfolio contained the stock known to be the ultimate 5g that will common knowledge soon. in fact it has been said in the first parts of september it should be announced by one of the first stock splitters on august 31. just that information is enough to tell you my $15k
was worth unlimited potential in the next 30 days. i had great positions and every single stock mentioned above was yielding 20%-60%. i think the 5g stock was actually at 66% last i checked at 4am on thursday just right before this occurred. 

looking thru records i found multiple accounts disclosed by peak 6 in july 2020 where this has been happening in mass. at the same time there are other subsidiaries with this parent company, so plenty of places to turn the funds into laundering capita and avoid true tax brackets that they pass on to those lower and middle income classes like me because they take upon themselves to liquidate without my request or approval - refusing to transfer not one account of 3. i had personal, ira, and custodial. well the ira and custodial come with extra special taxes. itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs one thing if i do it. itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs another like this. they can close an account bc they can but pretty sure there are laws especially dealing with retirement investments. i think enron ushered in quite a few. 

before i finish - one more note: my husband has stash, also, same stock but account is only worth a fraction of mine. not on 08/27 but 08/28 (my birthday at that) i receive an email to gift someone stash (wrong!) and his account gets locked / same process that happened to me. i told him to call the attorney, not stash, so itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs on record. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve made it personal to research documents. encourage others, do the same!",stash,birth,,,,0

2,"i love the mobile deposit option but the camera automatically captures images of the checks before the camera is in place and focused. it takes at least 10 tries to get a clear picture because the camera is automatically firing before the check is fully in view. it gets worse the more times you try.

automatic capture is totally unnecessary-i can easily tap the button once itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs in place.",schwab,camera,,,,0
2,"i mostly use this app for its check-cashing feature, and it's recent redesign makes it more clunky and difficult to use. there are several unnecessary steps that for some reason the app pauses on. for example, when you enter in the amount of the check you can't just tap the screen to get out of the typing mode you have to tap ""done""and there's like a five second pause where the app has to think. this sounds like a small problem, but it's really unnecessary and when you have to deposit multiple checks it actually adds a lot of time to the process. also when you photograph the check the app doesn't wait for the camera to autofocus. this means you have to watch the check and wait for the phone to focus before you take your picture as opposed to before where the phone would wait until the check was in focus for you. these may sound like small issues, but little design fixes would make this app a lot more usable for me.",etrade,camera,,,,0
2,"i now have to use a flashlight to take photos of the check so that the camera will focus, but then it still won't process because the pictures are not acceptable.  this is since the last update.",schwab,camera,,,,0
1,i only use the app for mobile deposit. it was working great until they updated 10 days ago. now the camera won't focus and it won't accept the pictures of the check. i'm not looking forward to mailing my deposits in and waiting a week.,schwab,camera,,,,0
1,"i opened my account since 6/27 and it required me send proper id through the app which i did. later i received email said the image is not clear and wants me retake, but when i log in to the app, there is no camera for me to retake the image and now the account is been under review of application for weeks! i sent email to support but no reply over 24h. i cant start my trading and its really waste of my time try to figure how to set up the account!",robinhood,camera,,,,0
2,"i quit using the old app as i had a deposit accepted via iphone then five days later fidelity says the image isn't good and i need to drive to a branch to deposit the check.  not wasting an hour.  

so now they have a ""new"" app with a better camera.  not so. after holding the camera over the front of the check for 15 seconds the app says the image isn't good, take a manual picture.  same issue on back of check. overall process takes too long.",fidelity,camera,,,,0
2,i really omly need it to deposit checks since i'm normally by my computer. the deposit camera only works half the time. the other half it tells me success after the front & back shots then when i try to submit it goes back to the snap photo screen but when it does work it's great,fidelity,camera,,,,0
1,"i signed up for robinhood months ago, iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve been waiting on my application for a long time, and the required information they asked for such as a picture. thereÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs no camera within my grasp that wouldÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve let have the ability to provide the correct information, all i had was being told that my application is under review, but this is getting ridiculous in my opinion, thereÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs no way to get help from what i can see, and the contact us section only provided questions once your account is approved rather than if thereÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs issues within the app that makes it difficult for someone to get approved",robinhood,camera,,,,0
1,"i use it but the camera for deposits is just awful.  get the program from b of a - theirs is fantastic.  fast and right every time.  i have to try multiple times with fidelity, and each attempt is soooo slow.",fidelity,camera,,,,0
1,"i use this app for one thing and one thing only: depositing checks. over the last several years, the process has gone from horrid to usable to pretty good. with the latest mitek auto-capture software, it's back down to unusable. the app auto turns on the camera light and then tells you there's too much glare irregardless if the check is on a light reflective surface or a black matte one. it is worse at auto focus and is mostly unable to capture a decent uploadable image. i gave up and went to my bank.",fidelity,camera,,,,0
1,"i use this app for one thing: depositing checks.

it used to be a breeze!  and i felt so high tech. i love schwab in almost every way. and then bam, now i can hardly deposit a check because the app thinks i'm using a camera from 1905 or something. i can't focus it at all.

why why why did you change from the old app imaging processor?

it's bad enough to make me seriously consider switching banks.

2,"i want to use this app mostly for depositing checks. unfortunately that's its worst feature. probably 19 of 20 attempts to take a photo of the back of a check i get an error that it can't focus. but it's not my camera, because i get great photos of checks using the native camera app. please fix this!",schwab,camera,,,,0
1,"i was forced to update to version 7.2.0 since the schwab site warned that previous versions would not work after 11/15/16. then i tried to make a deposit. apparently this new version uses its own built-in camera app whereas the old one used the native camera app. i found it impossible to focus on the front or back of the check. this is on an ipad mini running ios 9.3.5. since i only use this app to deposit checks (because a camera is necessary), the app is next to useless for my purposes.",schwab,camera,,,,0
1,"i would love this if it let me deposit checks, but something in the app prevents my camera from focusing. i spoke to schwab about it and their response was ""we've had less than 30 complaints about this so we're not going to fix it"". so now i'm stuck either changing banks or buying a new phone. reply to auto response bot: no you won't, and i've already called asking for help and was denied. losing another star for automated b.s. that is clearly lying.",schwab,camera,,,,0
1,"i'm sure there are some great features to this app but one of the main reasons i wanted an account with schwab was for the mobile and online services like mobile deposit. i tried to deposit a check and it would not take focused pictures in the app and there is no way to upload pictures taken with a other camera app that actually functions. this is a huge flaw for someone like me that really depends on these kind's of features in order to do my banking. i used chase mobile deposit and never had this problem, same phone, same camera. please give me better mobile options!",schwab,camera,,,,0

if this does not improve soon, i'm going to close my schwab account and switch to a brokerage that knows what they're doing.

i love that i have the ability to trade fractional shares without incurring additional trading costs, but this is far from the only app or website that offers that functionality. 
given the competitive environment, you would think that stash would offer a rewarding experience to its customers, but it punishes me every time i open the app with ads for life insurance and credit cards.
all i want from an app like this is to have charts and graphs that display my portfolio performance, and the ability to bookmark and buy stocks, bonds, and etfs.
it feels like 70% of the interface is devoted to trying to get you to open a bank account and use their debit card, 20% is devoted to selling third party goods and services, and the remaining 10% is useful information and workable interfacing. 
undoubtedly these percentages reflect their respective revenues from each sector, as the annual $12 subscription fee canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât really support their business model.

the issues with logging in and make me nervous, but in addition to this, the return on investment thus far has been so underwhelming that i am not sure it is worth keeping my money in this account. i thought it would be a fun side investment that i could watch grow, but instead i have watch my money languish when it could have been making more in a different mutual fund. i gave this several months, and have watched it fairly closely. i think my money is better off somewhere else.

i think it does get points for being a fun, easy, and generally user-friendly interface. it's unique and i think it could improve, but there's not a great deal of communication between the app and its users, so i feel little confidence that there will be improvements to the app in the near future.",acorn,credit card,,,,0

2,"i came here just for the promise of rounding up the dollar amounts on all of my purchases and investing that spare change. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve already been very successful with other investment tools like betterment.

this app bombards me with affiliate marketing, credit card offers, everything that i donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât want or need. the dashboard is optimized for satisfying their goals, not mine.

the one thing that iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm here for, investing loose change, doesnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât even work automatically. i have to open the app every day, get past all the promotions and offers to take even more money out of my account, and when i finally scroll down to the round-up area itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs not automated. i have to manually click each transaction to round it up and no matter how many i have there, the app stops me once i hit $5.

iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm not at all happy with this, and highly suspect of the 5 star rating. is it astroturfing? or do people just enjoy being shilled at every turn?",acorn,credit card,,,,0

2,"i have had this account for almost 3 years now.  it is nice to have an app that will do the math for rounding up the difference of what you spend and transfer it to a savings account.  it doesnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât cost much since it is only $1 per month subscription fee. 

until the recent update, it was nice being able to look at all of my transactions made on all my credit cards that were linked up with acorns.  heck, 2 years ago i was able to spot a fraudulent charge on one of my accounts and get that resolved before it became a bigger issue. acorns customer service was really good at helping me figure out the details of that fraudulent transaction, i even received calls from them and spoke to a customer service rep.  

however, the last couple times i have emailed them regarding and issue, i have not received a response.  they recently updated the app and now i am only able to see the last 2 most recent transactions.  unless i Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âround-upÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â those transactions, i cannot see any others.  well, once i have 2 transactions that require a full $1 Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âround-upÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â i cannot see any other transactions and i am not going to Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âround-upÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â full dollar transactions.  

since i have sent out an email asking how to see all of my transactions (about 4 days ago), i have not heard anything from acorns except from an automated message stating that they have a high volume of email they are responding to.  this is the same message i received before when i did not get any other responses.  

furthermore, i have had issues with a Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂlinkedÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â account and the issue has not been resolved even though when i try to click the link to resolve it, i get a message stating that the account has been Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âre-linked.Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â  it has not.  i emailed customer service about this and have not received a response.

the company has grown too big to keep up with customersÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â questions, and i am ready to close this account.  there are other apps which do the same as acorns without charging a monthly fee.  i have given them 2 stars because of the the horrible update and the 2 or 3 times i have emailed my concerns without responses from customer service.  therefore, they have 3 strikes.  had i received timely responses and the update wasnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât so horrible, i would give it 5 stars.",acorn,credit card,,,,0

1,"i like the idea of being able to track all my accounts. it took a long time to connect my bank accounts and credit cards (not sure if itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs safe). not all accounts are linkable, like applepay, but you can use the manual option to add an asset and liability. the other problem i had was in following the prompt to enter my home address without asking me if iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm an owner or a renter. the app connects this to zestimate and by the time i realized this was not applicable to me, it was impossible to remove. i looked up all the faqs and emailed for help. every time i click the account to try to remove it, iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm immediately sent to zillow/zestimate. the guy who replied to my email (it took days to even hear back) only gave me the standard faq which makes me believe that he does not understand the situation even after i have described it in detail. i also donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât like that iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm constantly reminded (top part of the app) to claim my comprehensive financial check.",personalcapital,credit card,,,,0

second, i have fraud charge and duplicate charge and none of the cannot be dispute. i told them that i do not have any information about the charge because that is a fraud and they keep telling me that i need to contact the merchant. i do not know either the customer service deaf or have a hard time understanding, but i told them i cannot contact them. and then, she gave me some sort of number that she believe from the merchant. try to call that number and of course, the number you are calling is not available. at the end, here i am, losing $14 and no one wants to give my money back. seriously, use your credit card. at least you can dispute things easily and if you are the one making trouble they will charge you back. this debit account is a scam.",stash,credit card,,,,0

1,"i really like the concept and the app, it's a great idea. it seems unfair that a lot of people are complaining about returns on their investment, that is really beyond acorns control, for the most part. this is definitely a long-term supplemental investment and savings tool, not a 401k. their customer support seems really willing to help, but is unable to solve what i would consider a basic problem. i use one credit card from a major international bank and i am unable to connect to my card. i was unable to connect when they launched the app and i am still unable to connect, after repeated exchanges with customer support. i verified all the parameters to link the accounts and triple checked them, but there seems to be a glitch that doesn't allow the account to link through acorns. they even verified it wasn't an issue on my side, but never fixed it. it is a little concerning when you can't just log on and simply link the most common type of credit card from one of the most prevalent card issuers.",acorn,credit card,,,,0
1,"i really like this app and the whole concept of personal capital, but...

both personal capitol & this app lack a budgeting feature! 

what i like about the personal capitol is that it's focused on your net worth. right on the top of the app and their page is a constant reminder of your balance between debts and assets. i'm young and want to focus on my future and don't have (or want to spend) the time using multiple services to plan my financial future. a budget is a big part of planning for a financial future. the fact that i can not do that with personal capitol is their weakest link. planning and controlling my spending allows me to plan more easily divert funds to investments. 

update: ""categories""
i have a few issues with the categories as well. all related to ""other"" subcategories. first, the other categories do not graph (like income & spending). secondly, and more importantly, credit card payments are categorized under ""other"" and thus do not show when you analyze your spending. of credit card payments are not spending, then you mortgage may as well be income.

bottom line: 
this app/service without a budgeting feature = 1 out 5 stars 
this app/service with a budgeting feature = 5 out of 5 stars",personalcapital,credit card,,,,0

2,"i started with acorn almost right after it launched. i did it to see how it stacked up on a earnings performance. i have invested thousands in incremental round-up. 

if your looking for a savings plan to sock money away, this will work, but this is not a investment program as the returns are 10-50% of comparable investments. that is an observation informed from more than a year of monitoring and comparisons. minor dividend, no clarity on investment mix result in a wash to the end user meaning acorn eats your incremental earnings. you effectively take the down side risk with no up side benefit while gaining the tax burden. 

then came the advertising... i could live with a Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âsave as you goÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â net result of this. they got all these ideas about network partners paying you and the. credit card offers and debit cards. they do everything they can to inform you via in app and email advertising.... every time you open the bloody app and while the app is open, it is all over the app itself ... screaming... incessantly for you to buy this or that so they can make money off of you.

i started a support ticket when the automatic bank link attempted to link my account with a credit card (wifeÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs) which is only linked to the bank account for bill payment, and there was no option to link my checking account. mind you i was logging into my checking account through the bank link, not the credit card. so i proceeded to link my checking account manually, verify, and set up deposits. suddenly my account was restricted and only able to close positions. had a few emails with support and they wanted my to verify identity with my id , checking account statement and credit card statement. since iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm not listed on the credit card i refuse to give them the statement as it wonÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât verify my identity and the account is not linked to my robinhood (i removed it once i saw it was the credit card and before i started the support ticket). now 1 week later i havenÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât heard back on why my wifeÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs credit card statement is needed to unlock my account or how it would help them identify me if iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm not on the statement and my account is still locked... currently closing all positions and trying to get money out and start investing with another brokerage with no luck.",robinhood,credit card,,,,0

started. first my account was stuck on ""setting up"" for well over the 5 
days it said it would take. then it invested my first $5.23. so i thought, 
ok this is cool. i waited a little while and watched that go up and down 
and such. nothing bad. i decided that i would trigger my next set of round 
up investments. i have mine on manual for now instead of auto so i can 
control the flow at first. hit the invest key. waited. waited. after a few 
days still no transfer from my funding source. finally got an email stating 
that they suspended my transfers because my bank says it might overdraft my 
account. now granted this account is not anything noteworthy. i use it to 
pay my credit card every payday and to fund my $5 investment. that's it. 
after paying my card there has been plenty for the $5 transfer. so ok, no 
control or fault of their own cuz it's the bank. so i tried it again later 
and still got the same result. still suspended. my biggest problem with the 
whole thing is that there are no updates to tell me what's going on. no 
idea if my transfers were cancelled or sitting in limbo. oh and the bank 
has no idea what i'm talking about. so i'm going to give it a few more 
days. if there is still no update or indication that something has changed, 
i'm gonna withdraw my $5 dollars and change, close the account and move on.

support for help with the issue. did that twice and have received any 
reply. if i don't hear something today i'm done with this.",acorn,credit card,,,,0

1,so this app is one of the best organized i have found. you get news and general information right in the palm of your hand. but i do find it a bit cumbersome to do any research on it. then it stays well behind the market every day. i find it funny that my banking and credit card apps tell me in seconds if any money has been spent or received yet this app canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât tell me for hours sometimes if a stock price has or is changing. then if i do want to buy or sell through the app i have to type in my password just to be able to get to the actual buy/sell cart. this takes valuable time and can make the difference in stock gains or losses. i already have to use my fingerprint just to get the app to open so why do i need to re-enter my password each time. bottom line is this app is only useful for a quick glance at work or on the go- just hope that you donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât really need to use it for anything more than an btw iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âll check on my portfolio. actually the apple phone stock ticker is way more accurate. so way to go developers for making a pretty app thatÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs actually useless for what it should be for.,tdameritrade,credit card,,,,0

1,"the app is really poorly designed from top to bottom. it advertises features like enable real time quotes (banner) but thereÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs no way to do so. the banner does nothing when prompted to touch it. customizing the hideous start page is equally disappointing. it advertises being able to show futures but nothing shows on the screen when toggled and refreshed.

the content cards are hideous. one has to swipe horizontally to see any of the data. there are content cards that advertise that trades are now free, which is wasted real estate.

accessing the fidelity visa details is equally disappointing. itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs like a pop over on the app that pulls on basic features of the card like recent transactions. but thereÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs no desire rich content like spending summaries or charts. everyone credit card app has these basic features (citi, amex, apple card), hell even wells fargo.

connecting to the app and getting access to your information is like watching a slug move through a pile a salt. it takes 6-10 seconds to show the login screen/touch is and another 10-12 seconds to pull back the data. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm on a gigabit line and mesh wifi.

1,"the app no longer has the ability to check credit card information, such as transactions. this is a huge disappointment, as this was one of my favorite feature of the app. now, a major reason i used this app has been removed, and really discouraged credit card users from using the app, or even easily looking up info about their account.",fidelity,credit card,,,,0
2,the app redesign has made everything so difficult to navigate and understand that iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm withdrawing my money and will invest elsewhere. where is the round up control? why did my credit card stop rounding up before i logged back in to discover nothing had been invested for months? i wonÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât be back unless i read that these issues and the ease of use has been fixed. why did you guys change a great thing?,acorn,credit card,,,,0
1,the app was fantastic 10 days ago. then they got rid of the ability to track your credit card purchases. what kind of company doesnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât allow you to view transactions on your credit card? complete joke. if they donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât fix this asap iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm getting a card with someone else.,fidelity,credit card,,,,0

2,"the investment part is fine, charles schwab research is good, no problem from this side. 

the banking/checking part is terrible, particularly if used as a joint account. when a debit card on the account is used as a credit card, the charge correctly shows as pending until the day it is posted, in which case, sometime between 12:30 and 1300 eastern time is the day the charge is going to be posted, the charges disappear and you bounce back to the previous balance, and these pending charges reappear as posted around 1900 that evening. if you are the only user of this card, it might not be a big deal, assuming you keep a accurate checking register on paper, your phone (separate from the charles schwab app), or you just are good with numbers. however if this is a shared/joint account, it makes it extremely difficult to use the banking/checking feature as a normal spending checking account.",schwab,credit card,,,,0

1,"they've made it virtually impossible to cancel from the android or desktop 
app. so please consider the below as a caution against ever joining acorns 
to begin with. the value of them charging $1 a month to invest your pennies 
is questionable. they invest in six specific etfs. you can use robinhood to 
buy them directly without fees. there's very little mystery here. acorns 
isn't doing anything complicated. ""but i can only invest a little every 
month."" then you're probably better off holding on to cash than using 
acorns. assuming you invest $100 in acorns in a year, you will have paid 
out 12% ($12) in fees. you're unlikely to break even at that rate. ""but i 
like their auto deposit feature."" do the same with robinhood and buy the 
etfs directly. or just buy them on demand (without auto deposit). ""but i 
like investing whole or partial dollars and not having to think about where 
the investments go."" then acorns might be good for you, assuming you have 
exhausted better investment vehicles that might be available to you like 
401k or hsa. ""but i like the found money feature."" well, if you game it 
right i'm sure you can get a few good deals. hats off to you. but it's the 
same sort of endeavor as playing the points games on credit cards. it will 
get tedious; the house always wins in the long run. look, i wouldn't be 
writing this if they made it easier to cancel. good luck trying. it's 
inordinantly difficult. avoid. edit: acorns has reached out and offered 
""assistance with closing my account."" i have already closed my account, 
which was a reprehensible challenge. can't do it from the android app, 
can't do it from the web app. it took a separate google search for how to 
close my account. it should not require an intervention. acorns, make it 
easier to cancel! ask yourself if your customers are clients or victims.",acorn,credit card,,,,0

1,"this app is a scam. while you think they are taking your spare change by rounding up your credit card purchases, they are actually taking the same amount of money from your bank account simultaneously, so in essence you are being charged twice. get your money out of this app asap! use tdameritrade instead. you can call them 24/7 and talk to a real person. this app is a good idea but in reality they are ripping people off.",acorn,credit card,,,,0
1,"this app is charging my credit card and i uninstalled it! update 9/16 the charged my credit card again! despite canceling my subscription, numerous emails to support and confirmation. 10/19 update after no less than three times contacting your customer service, finally,maybe, your staff has managed not to f#$& up the closing.",stash,credit card,,,,0
2,this app is clunky and lacks basic pin or finger print login access making it a chore to simply check balances. most modern bank or credit card apps have these basic and i would argue necessary features.,fidelity,credit card,,,,0

2,this app is so frustrating. the round ups for credit cards never seem to work i don't know if it's my bank or if it's this app but i have not had any satisfaction. it seems i was locked out of the login and i kept trying to get help but all it wanted to do was reset my password. i've been with acorn probably a year and a half and it has always frustrated me this app.,acorn,credit card,,,,0
1,this app promises and creatively disguises that it actually is just another savings account that's actually more expensive then one you can get at bank. while they do invest your money in stocks funds only they can choose based on how aggressive you want. this is where you learn you have little to no control. no website just an extremely vexing app with no support untill you actually close it you can get someone to respond. basicly you can't make money off this app it's more of place to spend your disposable income and not realize it's since it's provide little info and makes it effortless to setup withdrawal and deposit that offer very little information on where the money is going or coming from. if you link you credit cards it rounds up the balance and removes it from you checking account not the credit card or debit card. basically it just transfer funds to your acorns account from your checking whenever you spend money on your credit card that isn't a whole dollar amount. it's a waste considering they charge you monthly fees and your money is in the stock market that changes. it's to risky and to have almost no say on which stock your money is automatically invest into. it's tricky and effortless to transfer your money to them. definitely do not buy into this scam,acorn,credit card,,,,0
1,this app used to be amazing! then for some reason they decided to remove the ability to view credit card transactions in the app. the only reason i got the app was to make it easier to check my credit card and keep track of transactions. now that theyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve gotten rid of it iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm just going to delete the app and go back to only using the website. removing transactions completely destroyed the purpose of even having a fidelity app,fidelity,credit card,,,,0

1,"this app would get 5 stars but it won't allow me to link my amex debit card. not everybody has a credit card so i think debit cards with actual money in the account, like my account would be accepted. especially for beginning investors. not sure what they need so i'll also contact support.",robinhood,credit card,,,,0

1,"update 2018/08/30: an app update added a banner to the bottom that asks you to complete various tasks. these are tasks i donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât want to do, like add a credit card and set up a sales pitch appointment. 

itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs persistent and doesnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât appear to have a way to dismiss it. down to one star. 

for the last week or so, it hasnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât been able to connect to one specific e*trade account.  itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs a known issue by personal capital, and one that havens fairly regularly with this and other accounts. things will just stop working randomly. eventually they figure it out. eventually. 

for tracking net worth, itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs a fine app. i check it at least weekly. 

 their sometimes heavy handed sales pitches (including repeated phone calls) itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs hard to recommend. 

original: limited ability to make changes to entries
an accurate view of your financial picture is important and this tries to give it to you in an attractive package, but makes it too hard to fix the errors it has in assigning entries to categories. among other issues, you can't see information about what the entry is about, so it's hard to know what it should be changed to.

the app does have one of the best interfaces in the game though. my only further complaint is that they have no actual customer service. i have now spent over a month trying to cancel my monthly premium account, they call it robinhood gold, to no avail. you cannot get ahold of a real human if you have an issue. ultimately i had to just call my credit card company and tell them to block charges from robinhood.

1,"donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât get me wrong, the robin-hood interface is intuitive and easy to use and most definitely the future, unfortunately thatÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs about all the positives of robinhood. when signing up and trying to open an account i was told i would have to wait until 1-5 days for my account to get approved, which is fine and iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm okay waiting for 5 days. but after 3 weeks it was still not approved with absolutely 0 updates on whatÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs happening, so i sent an email asking why it was taking so long and a week later i got a lazy robot response saying they had a lot of people to go through. 

now, after 4 weeks of waiting i finally got some sort of update on my account that asked me for more information (a picture of my drivers license and a passports) but still that isnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât enough and it also wants a picture of my ssn card which i do not have and never received. i have also never needed this to open any bank accounts so why is it that robinhood needs this? is the other identification not enough? i have sent many emails but the customer service is terrible.

even if it is my fault, and i should have an ssn card, why have they held out on this information for a month?? was it that hard to ask for this information when signing up, that way i dinÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât have pour a month of my time into trying to get this stupid app to work?

iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm sure somewhere within all this waiting there is a good app but iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm giving it -stars because despite my best efforts and waiting an entire month i am not able to access the app. for that reason i would strongly suggest using another trading app, one with good customer service.

1,"%%do you ever check your average cost to be sure itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs correct?%%
i have been using robinhood for about a year now , i even referred people to open an account with robinhood. i would be a liar and deceitful if i say that robinhood treated me fairly or is transparent with their coin average costs. i recently sold all the coins i have and then later bought new ones when the prices were low. robinhood displayed a high cost average as the cost average of the new purchases. i emailed robinhood and talked with michael who told me his team has reviewed my account and that the average cost i am seeing isnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât official. that itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs just a guide. oh wait? robinhood showed me a high average instead of my actual average cost which is lower? i pressed him and literally had to solve math for him via email. that still wasnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât enough, michael still wonÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât be direct and admit the companyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs errors and fix the average. he kept saying the average cost i am seeing isnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât official. ok what is the official average? he offered to send me the csv file of my coins history. well i love playing with data using python and excel, i accepted his offer. i ran some codes and analyzed my coin history only to find out that i am right with claim. i sent my findings back to michael. this time he came clean and finally they were ready to tell me the shady underground way they make money from their investors. he told me that the average i am seeing is the average cost of the entire coins i have been buying since i opened robinhood account. thatÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs why itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs not official omg! my coin account is literally showing that iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm losing money and michael is telling me the average cost isnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât official. i am basically losing money because your app or your team failed to do their math right. how does this make any sense? i already sold all my coins before making the new purchases. the average cost has to be the cost of the new purchases i made and shouldnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât be related to the coins i already sold before buying the new ones. i had $0 and zero shares before buying the new coins. even an element child would tell you that the average cost would be the average cost of the new purchases i made.  as much i like robinhood, yÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âall lost me on this. referring my friends to use this app is probably one of things i would regret moving forward. use this app at your own risk. theyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âll never resolve your issue, theyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âll drag it out and your money in their pocket cannot be retrieved! their app also lags in sell prices during market run. i hate it to end this way.",robinhood,email,,,,0

not only does robinhood lie and collude with wall street insiders against their customers, but when you have a legitimate problem requiring support they donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât respond. submitting a support request generates a form email stating to expect a response Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âwithin 3 days.Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â three days is a totally unacceptable support response time in any industry, but even more so when your customer base is largely retail stock traders who depend upon quick reactions to changes in the market. do not use robinhood. webull, fidelity, and td ameritrade are all better options.",robinhood,email,,,,0

2,"i love the concept of this app and hope that they can improve on functionality. 

problem 1 - i created my account and when i open the app it asks me for my pin which i have never created. since i can't access with a pin i am forced to logout of the app then login with my username and password which then allows the app to work.  when you attempt to reset the pin there is not an option. app says contact customer support. 

statements - i requested a statement through the app which is the only way you can do it.  nothing happens on the app when you make that request but you do get an email that tells you to follow the link to view your statement. when i followed the link it tells you to login and my username and password. i tried to login using the same login credentials that worked on the app and they didn't work. there is no ""forgot password"" or ""forgot username"" option on this page. there is also no ""contact us"" section. so i went to the main acorns page and found a customer service number. called customer service and they told me they've never heard of that happening and didn't have an answer as to why that would happen. told me they'd look into it and call me back. that was a week ago - still no cal back. 

website - if you go to the website to try to actually login from the website you cannot. the option is not there. i believe this is being developed now and it should be. candidly, the app should not have been released until web functionality was up to par.

1,"i sent them $25.
i log-in weeks later, cool.  i changed my cell phone number.
few weeks later i log-in and it wants to verify me and send me an email. 
thatÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs cool email hasnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât changed. so i click on send me an email and i get an error that says they Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âno longer support email verificationÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â, only for phone verification is supported.  
why have (and keep) the email verify link if it never works anyway?
i donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât have that phone number!!!!  now i can get into my account.  
all very sketchy!  
do not change your phone number!
there is no way to contact them either!  none. zero outside the app!  and from what iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm reading, even inside the app it is next to impossible to get a hold of anyone.
it is a very suttle scam on their customers that change their numbers.
careful. thank god i only wasted $25 of my own money at first.  i also changed my banking information from them, quickly.
in reading a lot of reviews, i am also detecting a lot of Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂshillÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â, or fake reviews.

1,"i submitted a request weeks ago to transfer my funds to a different brokerage. they attempted to charge me a $75 fee for this as well as not sending over the securities for weeks. they then held the cash for another week and wouldn't respond to emails, tweets, or phone calls. sad to see this brokerage on the way down.",robinhood,email,,,,0
1,"i switched to e-trade to buy a couple of penny stocks that were extremely active. the transfer of funds from my ball didnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât work because the Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âverify bank accountÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â option on the app doesnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât work. so i had to call in and spend an hour and a half waiting for an operator. then because it takes so long to verify a bank account it had to be done by wire transfer.

any time i have an issue i can count on spending at least 1.5 hours on the phone just waiting for someone to answer. and the chat function on the app doesnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât work. 

nor does the messaging function. every time i try to reply to a message it tells Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âthe service you are trying to use in not working right now...Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â every single time i try to reply. and on top of that they always reply to my questions and issues with Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âcheck out faq page for common answers, and then if you canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât feel free to call us.Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â as if i hadnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât already spent 20 minutes trying to solve the problem myself by looking at their faqs. and of course now i get to spend an hour and half trying to get a person on the phone to fix the problem. 

this app is so bad it blows my mind. and itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs a financial institution! i have lost a couple of thousand dollars already just by not being able to execute trade orders in a timely fashion.  do not use this app. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm stuck until i can risk the week it will take to send my holdings to another company. in the meantime iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm screwed so take my advice and donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât get screwed. pick another company.

update: 5 months later and i can still expect an average wait time of one hour and twenty minutes for even the most basic questions answered. and days and days before an email is answered. worst customer service out there.",etrade,email,,,,0

1,"nothing but issues that they never explain to new traders who this app supposedly is for. bitcoin doesnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât count for day trading minimum. no customer service. nothing by phone, email only while they take 3 days to respond with a generic answer. switched to ameritrade better hours, much better customer service and better stock info with otc stocks available. itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs not even close, rh is terrible",robinhood,email,,,,0
1,"now when i open the app i get bombarded
with an advertisement style home page.  the overall look and feel of the app is less professional and irritating.   the previous drop down menu was more helpful in my being able to navigate the app.  not so easy to find performance graphs.  i plan to  transfer all my funds to a different investment provider and uninstall acorns unless acorns becomes a more to the point and intuitive app.  itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs lost itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs intuitiveness.  i have twice messaged for help and itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs been several days and still no response.  growth is no excuse for not keeping up with the corresponding increase in demand for technical assistance. hire more qualified personnel to respond to your customerÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs needs.  donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât respond to this review with excuses within this review section. instead please email me with answers to my questions which i sent through the app.  thank you.",acorn,email,,,,0

1,"on feb 24, i requested to have my portfolio rebalanced. flash forward to march 9 and my portfolio still isnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât rebalanced. instead it is still Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âmoderately aggressiveÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â in a very volatile market. when i finally reach out to customer support on this day they realize their error and finally change my portfolio to Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂconservativeÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â. they told me that portfolio rebalanced typically occur within 2-3 business days, that they didnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât know what happened and that theyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âd get back to me with answers. as a result of this error i lost nearly $300. i sent many emails and messages to their customer support and still hadnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât received an answer as to why this happened. this was not my mistake, this had nothing to do with my bank, this was a system error by acorns. come march 18, i call customer support and later that day i finally get a response and all they tell me is that it was a Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âone-time errorÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â and in their attempt to make it right they offer me waived subscription fees for the next three months. keep in mind that means their idea of making up for losing me $300 is to save me $3. i am an experienced investor with accounts with several different brokerages. i wanted to try acorns because it was something new, but it was a mistake and iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm warning everyone else to stay away unless you like being treated like dirt and donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât value your money. their investing software clearly canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât be trusted with these errors occurring that they canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât even explain. their customer service takes very long to respond and they certainly know how to make you feel like you donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât matter. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm sure after seeing this theyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âll give some cookie-cutter response and maybe theyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âll actually try to better explain what was behind their error. they have an f rating on the bbb and rightfully so. the only way they could make this right is by putting the money i lost as a result of their error back into my account, but instead they offered me $3. now iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm going out of my way to make sure everyone knows what a joke of a company this is.

update:
now they choose to respond to my complaint with a cookie-cutter response telling me theyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âd like to look into this if i contact customer service. what do you think iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve been doing for the past month?? iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve already raised this issue to your customer service and iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve received zero help! how clueless can a company be?",acorn,email,,,,0

1,"please, take my advice and do not use this service. it is such a hassle verifying your bank account as a funding source. i have been trying for a month now to get my new bank account established with acorns, and even though they said weeks ago that the documents i submitted were sufficient to verify the source, it still has not been done. i have no access to my money, and i havenÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât for some time. if the markets were to tank and iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âd want to pull my money out, or if i was in a financial crisis and needed access to my savings, i canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât even take any action on my account. too add to all of that, their customer service is awful. they take days to respond to an initial inquiry and now theyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve stopped responding to my emails altogether. please find a better way to invest your money, because right now it wonÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât be safe with acorns.",acorn,email,,,,0
1,poor customer service. monday morning when the price was 5.40 of amd i wanted to sell but the app crashed and price went  down to 5.10i was constantly emailing customer service they responded but not fixed the issue. at around 1pm the problem was fixed by then i lost my profits and had to take a huge loss so please be careful while using it,robinhood,email,,,,0
1,"pros: 
1. user friendly.

2. good option if you are going to work with penny stocks. 

cons: 
1. there is no personalized customer service. all communication is via email. they are supposed to answer within 3 days, and sometimes they donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât answer at all, if they do answer they just copy and paste an automatic response. 

2. be prepared for possible crashes and outages that can cause major money loss. last one happened march 2nd and 3rd (2020). i could not access my account from any device. this caused me to loose $14,000 because i could not close my positions. 

robinhoodÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs response: $15 credit for membership to robinhood gold and $75 credit for the goodwill store which they never even sent. Ã£Â°Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂÃ¢Â¤

3. be prepared to receive many messages that say you cannot buy bitcoin in your state or that you are not authorized to do so, or see Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂmaintenanceÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â when btc is either crashing or going up.

robinhoodÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs response: oh it was an error

4. in the morning peak hours, be prepared to see your portfolio value change inconsistently. for example, if your portfolio is worth $42,000, when the market opens, your value can shift to $25,000 out of nowhere. sometimes it puts more money than you already have, causing confusion. 

5. option trading is a joke. donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât believe the free-commission scam. 

6. they can block you from your own account.",robinhood,email,,,,0
1,"put an initial investment in and after that, nothing happened. when i would log in to the app or the website, it would say my accounts weren't verified. after emailing to figure out way this was the case, they told me i had switched funding sources too many times, so now i needed to verify my accounts. i never actually set a funding source, which means they were switching them automatically, as i linked accounts. the app just said ""we're in the process of verifying your accounts."" ???",acorn,email,,,,0

1,"robinhood halted trading on multiple stocks this morning (1/28/21) unexpectedly. they halted trading on gme and nakd to name two, plus many others stocks as well. they sent an email explaining that they were protecting their clients. they also changed margin requirements as well. this app truly changed the way people invest, but stopping me from trading certain stocks with no good explanation is what has driven me to choose a more reliable trading platform.
            robinhood has awful customer service and there is no one to call if you need help. they offer frequently asked questions and an email if you need to speak to an agent. it takes days to respond to messages.

now i do not know what to think and am i going to get my money? i am not even sure. 

anybody who wish to invest with this app should do their due diligence and stay with reputed brokerage firms. 

i am using since last week and ui could be better. i have robinhood which i really like for ease of use but stash have a lot of information on home page which is unnecessary. 

1. allow users to customize their home page.
2. ability to transfer money to investment at different times e.g invest on apple bi-weekly and facebook monthly.
3. provide some kind of pie chart to see % of holding by sectors and performance chart of portfolio overtime.

listen to your customers and you will do great or someone else design a better product.

2,"completely inflexible future savings inputs. allows only one amount that applies to all future years.   can not enter future planned expenditures. i even tried entering negative amounts, but no. one number is all it will take for a savings rate and it applies it to all future years.  

does not handle cds in your brokerage accounts, treats them as cash or unknown and the rate of return is not recognized, so it cannot forecast returns accurately.  

what it does is it logs onto all of your accounts and pulls in transaction and balances and categorizes them.  it does a good job of this, but frankly thatÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs not hard to do periodically on your own in excel.  and now that excel has the stock quote data type itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs easy to track investment values.  

if this app allowed future planned outflows from each account to be input and used in its retirement planner, and if it could track cds and bond interest rates and maturities, coupled with its prediction on portfolio performance, it might be useful.   as it is, it is just a data mining tool that collect all of your financial transactions into one place  and that is a bit scary, isnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt it?  it would be worth it if you got something useful in return like facebook does, but this just collects your info and gives you a very mickey mouse simple set of graphs instead of true forecasts.",personalcapital,facebook,,,,0

1,"i logged onto robinhood a month or so ago hoping to invest, learn, and grow as an investor. i transferred several deposits early and was trading about $1200. over that month i decided to slowly dump more cash for trading into my robinhood account. on 10/14/2020 i deposited $1000. two days later i noticed two separate transactions of $1000 each was pulled from my banking account. when i reached out to robinhood they insist i initiated two separate transactions within 20 seconds of each other. now that is just silly. who would do that and why. regardless, i am 100% certain that i did not initiate two transactions of $1000 each within 20 seconds. it may have a been a glitch. idk. thankfully i have the money not only to cover the transactions but to also cover my cash needs in the 12 days it would take to get my money back. what is most concerning is customer services insistence that (a) itÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs not a big deal, (b) eventually my account will receive the $2000 and i can just transfer back if i need/want to. (c) there is no way it could be a glitch, but i must have gotten sudden short-term memory loss and not realized i pressed deposit four times to make two transfers. 

too add insult to injury they asked me to send them a pdf of my bank statement making sure i include my first and last name, my address, my bank name, my account type, and my account number.... i am not sure why they didnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât just ask for my pin too! how is a pdf of my bank statement that includes all that info help them investigate a double transfer that took place on their tech! how??

1,"i donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât even know where to begin. i am an ex user of robinhood and attempted to move to fidelity. working with them and their customer service has been the worst iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve ever dealt with in my life. it took them over two weeks to try to figure out why my linked bank account wasnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât working. they kept making up excuses saying that since my account was previously a 401k acct through another employer, something is screwed up on the back end. so i create a new account(same login) and follow the step by step directives of support. fail yet again.

after finally figuring out that debacle, i downloaded this app and started researching my positions that i had held with robinhood. i wasnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât about to pay rh $75 transfer fee as they are as bad as fidelity. after a bit, iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âd realized that the prices displayed to you indicate that the prices reflected are as of Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âdate and timeÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â. this date and time shows the timestamp of now, yet is actually data from yesterday. who on the planet wants to look at prices and quotes of stocks available this moment as of closing prices from the day before. after contacting customer support, i was told Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âyou obviously have to apply and request that your app to be real timeÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â. wow, yes, please let me request for me to actually see the real prices and not crap thatÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs a day old, thanks. didnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât realize it required special permissions for me wanting something so blatantly obvious. even after Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âreal-time quotesÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â are enabled, you open up the app and data is still 15 minutes old.

then comes the part of enabling options. i apply to trade options(yay, more requesting of me for them to allow me to do what i want with my money) and a few days later, iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm sent an email saying iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âve been approved. sweet, finally something goes right! i try to purchase some calls and puts and guess what? error stating i need options enabled. w...t...f... support tells me iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm enabled and isnÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât sure of whatÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs going on. finally, they see i was approved for only level 1. guess what the solution to this issue is? Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âfeel free to re-applyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â is what i was told. i immediately dumped my portfolio right there on the spot and am now waiting for everything to clear so that i can get as far away from these old-timers as possible.

for you folks who want to leave robinhood, iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm right there with you! do not go to fidelity thinking youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âll get to do anything that youÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âd been already doing for years on rh. iÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âm going to try td and their app, think or swim. fingers crossed it wonÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât be a nightmare like fidelity is.",fidelity,permission,,,,0

i finally reach a phone rep who was just as useless as their online customer service. she places me on hold for 30 minutes to tell me that thereÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs nothing that she can do. she tells me that an account specialist will get back to me today so that i can have access to my account. seriously? i have to ask for permission to have access to my investments. they act like they are doing you a favour when they are supposed to be a business that provides you service. there was no guesstimate time i should expect a call. thanks again.

well, 6 hours go by, almost the end of their business day, and no call back. so, i have to call again. i speak to another rep who places me on hold for another long time who tells me that he cannot do anything either. then proceeds to tell me that someone will get back to me in 24-48 business hours. what the heck does that mean? this is poor service. when i enquired as to why canÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât i speak to the department that can help me, he states that they donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât have a call centre in nyc. thanks for nothing yet again. 

this is clearly not just personal experience but, rather they donÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Ât value their customers. i want all my money out of their accounts now. and, whatÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs crazy is that they have me hog tide with no ability to resolve the issue. essentially, you will get tired of trying to reach them and they'll just have all your money. these are unacceptable business practices. i'm going to reach out to the better business bureau and other regulatory institutions.",stash,permission,,,,0

robinhood does offer a debit card however this is something that can also be offered with other brokerages like schwab.

1,i have been trying to open an account for over 2 months! at one point they finally approved me but said my email on the account was an email i have never used. so i contacted them saying that my email is incorrect and that i think someone may have created an account using my name. so after another 3 weeks of having to send them my personal information and documents they sent an email saying my request was rejected because i already have an account. i would not even waste you time with this company because obviously if something happens you will not be able to get it resolved. the customer service is terrible. absolutely no help at all. they do not listen to what you are saying and take anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks to reply,robinhood,personal info,,,,0

1,"to all:  customers support is by far the worst.   my account had fraudulent activity and it was reported within hours.  this happened 3 weeks ago.  support has yet to resolve or help the situation.  they even allowed a bank account to be linked after the account was reported as being fraudulent.  all iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve received are automated responses through email.  no contact # that is actually a customer support #.  i will have my account closed asap.  really, all beware.  
the worst part is that i will probably get help now that itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs on a review.

edit for response:  hahahaha, i knew it!  that was the quickest response from robinhood ever.  why would i open another ticket?  my god.  how can someone be so blind to what they say and how ironic it is.  letÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs continue to have our communication through the review system.  it at least gets your attention.

edit2: well another ticket opened.  how long will this one take?  for the same problem ticket after ticket, with nothing but automated responses.

edit3-my review to rd ameritrade :

edit7: just placed a review and complaint with the bbb.  come to find out robinhood isnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt accredited with them.  wow!  again all beware!!!! scam!!!  other reviews on the bbb website are the same, no customer support.  still no response.  every time they respond to me on here i email them at the requested email, and still nothing.  iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm thinking class action law suit how long are we going to allow these criminals to get away with ripping us off?

edit8: another week and still no progress.  filed another complaint with the bbb.  it will continue.  i truly hate this company now.  it went from annoying to hate.  i will get my money

1,"i really wanted to like this app and this company. i waited on the waiting list for what felt like forever to get an account, but am ultimately leaving because of two things: 

1) i understand the need to ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂkycÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ (know your customer), but this app asks for a photo of your social security card with zero attempt to make you feel comfortable providing it. they mention nothing about why theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre asking for it or what theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll do to secure your privacy. thereÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs not even a ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂlearn moreÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ link directing people to their website. it took me 6 minutes to find this weak sentence on their website, ""that said, we take the security of all collected data very seriously. we do not intend to use this data for anything other than the fulfillment of our regulatory requirements."" umm, how about saying ""we will never use this data...""?!

2) customer support. it took nearly 2 weeks for my customer support inquiry to be answered. and you expect me to give you a photo of my ssn?! again, no sense of security should you need it. the app looks like a junior high schooler put it together. sorry, but the level of sophistication with this company is just too underwhelming for me to get on board right now.

2) customer support. it took nearly 2 weeks for my customer support inquiry to be answered. and you expect me to give you a photo of my ssn?! again, no sense of security should you need it. the app looks like a junior high schooler put it together. sorry, but the level of sophistication with this company is just too underwhelming for me to get on board right now.

as a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including sec net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment. these requirements exist to protect investors and the markets and we take our responsibilities to comply with them seriously, including through the measures we have taken today. 
to be clear, this decision was not made on the direction of any market maker we route to or other market participants.

my current experience with the app (it's the latest version - to cut off one more excuse on their end) is horrible, refresh rate of quotes is unbearable, notifications do pop out when they are already outdated, touchid support fails when u need it the most and the list goes on & on... i didn't even mention apple watch experience here to save readers from the endless sadness and frustration.

i had my faith in fidelity a few releases back but things are just getting worse and if there were another app to manage my fidelity financial experience i would take it without a doubt.

robinhood is also limiting trading for certain stocks. they'll allow you to buy up to 5 stocks of certain companies. this is to ""protect"" you. they think you're too stupid to be aware of the risks. their actions against their users are criminal and cost people money.
further robinhood has placed restrictions on crypto. they will only allow me to sell. once the crypto is sold you can't buy any more as it is put into you're brokerage account and only available for stock purchase. this has prevented me from repurchasing crypto at a more desirable price and cost me tremendously in opportunity cost.
lastly with crypto robinhood does not have a system in place to withdrawal your crypto which should be illegal. crypto at this point should be considered a commodity and be available at all times for withdrawal like gold and silver. essentially you can't use your crypto for private payments.

too many glitches in the app.  

at times the dollar amounts (balances, gains) are way off and periodically the text and numerical are in chinese/mandarin, even when the settings are for english.

2,"app has improved significantly over years but pace of innovation is not matching efficiency with which fidelity deducts commissions from my account.

fidelity is late to game for mobile-first solutions for retail-working-day traders.

for example, app now has option info but placing a multi-leg option trade could be better done on a slate by a goat than your app. improve it!!

option pairing - options are treated as individual security with no tie in whatsoever to other legs or underlying long or short stock position. i can know whether leg 1 has increased or decreased x% but practically useless for multi-leg options.

alerts - alerts work but they could be easily set and refreshed (especially ones which are price-triggered as opposed to ema or ma)

i can write about few other defects but let's first get these fixed !!

2,"hi, my name is edwin ayala. 
i learned about the robinhood app 2 years ago.
my friends and family talked about it and had a mini debate on this application.

iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm a rocky on this app and it seems a bit interesting. my portfolio items show a profitable growth but i did notice lots of my ffs (friends family) did not had the option to withdraw from the robinhood to their bank. 

a user can make a deposit in a second and itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs available right away for him/her to buy stocks, it is not as collateral. i found that cuestionable as a business administraciÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ³n grad and common sense question. why is it prolonged to withdraw?

my rating to this robinhood app is a 2 star cause financial liquidity is essential, therefore the app should consider making a faster way for its user investor to get its money from either lost or revenue. 

i did read it says to protect from money laundering and other security issues to protect us as users but itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs also recommendable to make that cashing experience fun and time accurate.

1,"i tried to log into my stash app on tuesday , it said my account was locked. i taught someone from stash would have reached out,  but no one did. the issue was, for some reason stash was having some problems with my external linked bank account. 

i opened a ticket. no one got back to me and i had to wait 2 days, then, i  called in to get support for the issue. the customer service representative said, i had to prove that i own the bank account that i was using since 2019 to invest in stash. what? i said to myself. 

 the representative replied my email while i was on the call with him, in the email, the rep specified that i had to prove my bank account by reaching out to my bank for bank statements. i explained that i had an issue with my bank and the bank account number that i was using to invest on stash got changed by my bank because of security reasons,  but i will get the required documentation to prove it is my bank account.

i replied the email with the required information. then,  i called in again to inform them that i had sent the required information. the rep put me on hold to look at the documents and after 3 minutes, she got back to me and said, some other department will reach out by email. i asked if the dept could help me unlink my old account number and link a new one. she said i had to call back after i got the email from the mystery department. the call with the rep was 5 hours ago and still no email from the mystery department. 

then i said to myself, this is the reason why robinhood has better reviews than stash. stash is a piece of crap as per customer service and is not that the app is even that great.  what does stash do awesomely? i asked myself. i know, they donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt have problems withdrawing your money. thatÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs what they do awesomely.

2,"i want to like the app, since that is what fidelity seems to push.  however, before i can love it, it needs to be much better.  on the website, with a click of a button, i can see all of the details of a security, from earnings to dividends to analyst rating and news.  on the app, i need to hunt that information, and i canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt perform the same depth of research or at least not easily.  of course, then there is everything else: closed positions, tax forms, the exit strategy view, rich visualizations, etc.  if they are here at all, they are laid out differently and buried.  

if this is the app, then the app needs to recognizably duplicate all of the features of the website for me to prefer its use.  at the moment, i only see this as a dumbed down version of the website. it is such a missed opportunity, too.  ios should be more feature rich than a browser, not less.  they could have designed something more real time that more closely resembles active trader pro.  instead, they went to the opposite end of the spectrum and gave us a crippled app.",fidelity,security,,,,0

1,"i warned personal capital that i would give them this bad review if they couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt resolve the multiple issues i have had over the last 9 months and well, the issue i had today has pushed me over the edge. here we go:

i use to love this app until it stopped working with my multiple capital one accounts, usaa investment accounts and now my empower retirement account. all of which affect my cash flow analysis and net worth rather significantly. 

the biggest issues: capital one has both savings (bank) and credit card accounts. the initial problem was that pc said it was coÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs fault (systemic problem) but that they had ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂescalatedÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ the issue in tech support. they told me not to remove the account or try to reinstall it. more than 5 months later, they did not nothing to resolve the problem. i went ahead and removed the co account to see what would happen. after reinstalling, it works, however, it will not update on its own like other accounts. i have to request a code be sent to my phone each time. additionally, today, my main co credit card account (which i place most of my purchases on) was mysteriously gone when i tried to manually request the code to be sent. this is rather frustrating because now all my categorized expenses are completely wiped out and i have to restart everything. majorly affects cash flow and net worth. i tried to reinstall the account but pc gives me an error. says ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂwe are having trouble updating co credit cards-1. the issues are usually related to problems with a financial institutionÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs website... yada, yadaÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ. this is completely unacceptable. capital one is a huge company and there is no reason for this to carry on. my smaller accounts sync better. may have to do with a larger company using tighter security or what not, but pc should be working extra hard to make sure these problems donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt persist. 

additionally, my usaa investment accounts suddenly stopped updating at the end of last month. i was again told that the issue would be escalated to tech support and they would let me know when it was resolved. itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs been more than 2 weeks... nothing back. i wish i could remove the account and reinstall but itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs tied to my banking and this would mean i would lose nearly a year of data. 

my empower retirement (403b) account is most important to determine net worth and retirement planning... it has completely stopped updating too even though i tried to remove it and reinstall. fortunately, when i reinstalled it, it at least has a balance close to actual amounts. i will likely have to remove and reinstall every few months to ensure my net worth is someone accurate. the kicker... there is a flag on it now that says ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂthis account appears to be closedÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ... this is a bead scratcher bc i have 2 other empower retirement plan accounts that are having no trouble u dating. 

pc needs to get their act together and resolve all the glitches or iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm afraid they will begins to receive more and more bad reviews. 

beware, if you own any of the accounts i just listed above, you may want to try a different app to track your finances.",personalcapital,security,,,,0

not directly related to the ios app, but going it mention here: a gtc stop order is impossible to cancel after hours: the cancellation is going into pending forever and if you need to get out of position, you canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt - the only way is to call fidelity, spend enormous time with a live person to get the stuck order verified cancelled.

continue to experience difficulties updating data from some sources because pc is not showing me the additional security questions that some of the vendors require to log in. after i notify pc team of issue, they fix the issue but this should not require notification. 

closed a auto loan with one vendor and opened a new auto loan with same vendor. was previously able to see details on original loan, but have yet to be able to pull up data on new loan. corresponded with pc team several times to ensure itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs accessing the correct url, but to no avail. as an aside, i can access the data perfectly by going straight to the companyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs website, but that defeats the purpose of an aggregation app.

most recently my pin was not working so i went through the forgot pin process in which it lists 3 of my vendors, asking me to choose one and provide the password to authenticate itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs me. received an error message saying it could not authenticate device even though i know i was providing the correct passwords. email to pc team results in ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂprovide screenshotÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ response.

1,"not only does robinhood sell your data, but at any moment they will freeze stocks that are performing too well in order to save the short sellers who fund robinhood on the back end as clearing houses. these are the funds they sell your order history and other data too. the customers they actually care about.

today robinhood disabled the buying (but not selling) of stocks which had been undergoing massive rises as retail investors jumped in. this is market manipulation to drive down the price of a security, which is illegal. this was done at the behest of citadel, a market manager and customer of robinhood which had sold short shares of the companies in question. short selling is a bet that the security will drop in price, a bet citadel was badly losing along with massive amounts of money. until robinhood decided to disable all purchases of the stocks in question that is.

2,"robinhood is an app that allows anyone with a social security number to be able to buy and sell securities and options contracts. the interface is clean and simple, and the app assists you in learning how to trade as a beginner.

however, you will be often reminded that while this app is available to retail traders, the developers donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt care about you. some days youÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll find that you wonÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt be able to make trades, or even close your current positions due to any of the following:

1. robinhood will straight up limit what stocks you can purchase, and how many, on any day theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂd like. this is because they make substantial deals with hedge fund managers aimed at ensuring that the poor stay poor (look up securities limitations and youÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll see exactly what i mean).

2. customer service is practically non-existent. if you find a bug in the app, or run into any kind of issues with the platform, expect a response along the lines of ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂoopsie, whoopsie! we screwed this up and canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt fix it, but i promise weÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll try super hard to prevent that from happening again!ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ

3. they forgot to program leap years into their software. i wish i was kidding about this. i had friends lose thousands of dollars because robinhood forgot that leap years existed. maybe theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll have that fixed by 2024. 

4. or maybe they just didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt keep their servers cranking well enough to support the traffic, and none of your positions will even be available to see when you open the app, never mind trying to buy or sell.

tldr: you get what you pay for. and this app is free. if you want a good brokerage, find one thatÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs well established and has capital to cover their screwups. if you just want to have fun and donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt care about your money, this is the app for you!",robinhood,security,,,,0

your money is at risk with this app. do yourself a favor and use another more established brokerage app that is secure and has excellent quick customer service with research and lessons available.",robinhood,security,,,,0

1,"i really wanted to like this app and this company. i waited on the waiting list for what felt like forever to get an account, but am ultimately leaving because of two things: 

1) i understand the need to Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂkycÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â (know your customer), but this app asks for a photo of your social security card with zero attempt to make you feel comfortable providing it. they mention nothing about why theyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âre asking for it or what theyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âll do to secure your privacy. thereÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âs not even a Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âlearn moreÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â link directing people to their website. it took me 6 minutes to find this weak sentence on their website, ""that said, we take the security of all collected data very seriously. we do not intend to use this data for anything other than the fulfillment of our regulatory requirements."" umm, how about saying ""we will never use this data...""?!

2) customer support. it took nearly 2 weeks for my customer support inquiry to be answered. and you expect me to give you a photo of my ssn?! again, no sense of security should you need it. the app looks like a junior high schooler put it together. sorry, but the level of sophistication with this company is just too underwhelming for me to get on board right now. 

robinhood should practice Ã£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢ÂkycÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Â and realize quickly that theyÃ£Â¢Ã¢ÂÃ¢Âd have gobs more clients if only they could give them a modicum of reassurance on privacy and customer support.",robinhood,social security,privacy,security,,0

unfortunately, they have not fixed my problem. since april 16,  i sent at least four pleading emails. customer service has not responsed to my requests for assistance. today is april 20, 2020.

another important point; customer service does not provide a phone number for customers.

1,started my application least 2 weeks ago and said takes 1-3 days to open an account and for it to be approved or they'll ask for more information but after a few days it said it'll take 1-5 days and that i'd get another free stock for the delay. now 2 weeks at least since i submitted my application i haven't heard anything +theres no option to contact them to ask but i finally contacted via a different help section and they asked for my signed ssn card which is crazy so i refuse to use this app,robinhood,ssn,,,,0
1,"stash has been reporting my name wrong to apex clearing for the past 2 years and i have been trying to get it corrected for just as long. i have had to send w-9 forms and a copy of the ssn twice to apex. and i submitted a ticket to stash in december of last year to correct my name and i was under the impression it has finally been corrected. but that was not the case. this year, i received a letter from apex saying that as i have already received 2 warnings in the previous years, they are just going to start withholding 24% of whatever i earn through stash. when i called stash again today, they finally told me that my name is too long and that's why it is getting abbreviated and reported wrong to apex clearing. and they still don't know if or when they can fix it.",stash,ssn,,,,0
1,still can't verify my ssn and bank.,robinhood,ssn,,,,0

1,the app hasn't let me finish creating my account. right after it asks for ssn it says server error.,robinhood,ssn,,,,0
1,"the stupid sign up process on the app fails to identify my ssn card on it's photo taking part, customer support gives no help at all, tired of app developers putting huge potholes in their half ass developed p.o.s",robinhood,ssn,,,,0
1,the support team never responded after requesting my ssn due to suspected fraud. it has been months of me trying to get a response from them and nothing on their end.,robinhood,ssn,,,,0
1,they created my account without verifying my ssn card initially and now they deactivated it while saying its not valid ssn card. i got thie new ssn card made 6 months back but their customer support just told me its not valid without telling me the reason for it. moreover all my funds are stuck there without any help from support. be mindful of their support when investing through robinhoof,robinhood,ssn,,,,0
1,they have terrible customer service and they also ask for a green card if you are an immigrant ( while other similar platforms only ask for your ssn ),robinhood,ssn,,,,0
1,they withheld taxes from my account because they said my ssn didn't match the irs even though i sent in the from twice and then a 3rd time. almost made it so i had to drop out of escrow to buy a house.,stash,ssn,,,,0
1,"theyve taken my ssn 3 times, and still havent approved me. now they want me to add it funds while waiting to be approved again. what a joke",robinhood,ssn,,,,0
1,"this app has been a constant disappointment since installation. despite marketing itself as free trading for the retail investor, the amount of cowardly back tracking they have taken in the last few days has leaved me frustrated. i'm an adult, you have my ssn and information and can confirm that i am an adult. let me assume the risk that i am knowingly taking. stop treating me like a child.",robinhood,ssn,,,,0
1,this app is confusing i had a account for two weeks now haven't used it since i set everything up when i finally decided to use it it made me start all over again when it ask me for me ssn i put it in and it told me i already have a account i'm trying to figure out since i already have a account why it's not allowing me to log in to it ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ°ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¤ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ°ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¤ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ°ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¤ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ i guess i will be using acorn instead,stash,ssn,,,,0
