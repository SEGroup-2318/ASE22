investing,1,"first, iã¢ââm a huge fan how simple wealthfront makes investing in stocks. this review is on the cash account only. i want to make a bigger purchase this weekend and was saving every penny for this - putting my savings on the cash account in anticipation that i can withdraw this cash easily when i want to make the purchase. i initiated the withdrawal on monday morning and still donã¢âât see any cash on my bank account (4 days later), even tho they tell you it takes 1-3 days for the cash to hit your account. they also freeze deposits you make for 5 business days until you can withdraw them again for ã¢ââsecurity reasonsã¢ââ. i also have a cash account with american express and made the transfer at the same time as wealthfront. my cash from then arrived one day later! this experience with welthfront cash is very frustrating, especially because i know that i have the money, itã¢ââs just frozen on their account! worst case, i have to take out a loan to make the purchase because wealthfront failed to make a transaction on time! thanks for this, wealthfront!",11/28/2019 18:33,wealthfront,apple
investing,1,"the one nice feature of this app is to have a place where all your accounts are linked. this allows you to see all your accounts on one platform, but there are many other apps that allow you to do this.

returns through wealthfront are extremely poor. my investment strategy is set to the most aggressive option. now i understand that you see large swings with an aggressive investment strategy, but i only ever see large changes when iã¢ââm losing money. markets are doing well and i make extremely small returns. markets are doing alright and i lose money. markets are doing poorly and i lose more money. add in the management fee and i lose more money. stay away from this app if youã¢ââre looking to make money. 

i started this account to invest through something i didnã¢âât have to monitor. i now see that i made a big mistake. after 2 years and a negative return, i think itã¢ââs time to take my money elsewhere. could have made more money in a standard savings account than through wealthfront.",8/26/2019 19:28,wealthfront,apple
investing,1,"i wasnã¢âât interested in investing, as there are much better services out there. i thought iã¢ââd use the savings account since wealthfront offers much better interest rates than most savings plans. you can get started with a small amount of money, and nowhere does wealthfront state that thereã¢ââs a minimum amount required in an account to earn interest. it even says interest is earned quickly, with no long waiting period. i made my deposit and waited. after several months, i never received any interest. i withdrew my initial deposit and got rid of this app. thereã¢ââs no point in chasing a higher interest rate since wealthfront doesnã¢âât pay interest on savings accounts, contrary to all their promises.",9/11/2019 8:22,wealthfront,apple
investing,1,"during the 2017 prime time, my wealthfront portfolio return rate was about 15% while in that year nasdaq was up for more than 30%. what can i say about it?

another pain point is tax filing. the so-called ã¢ââtax-loss harvestingã¢ââ is nothing but marketing gimmick. it increased my tax filing burden by 10x ~ 100x.

even if i chose a ã¢ââfundã¢ââ in wealthfront and held it for more than a year, wealthfront logged *every single transaction* it automatically executed on my behalf on my tax forms. when tax season came, i ended up receiving dozens of transaction records on my tax forms. it was impossible to file tax for them without a turbotax-like software that can automate the tax form importing. even more stupidly, wealthfront bought foreign funds for like $20 value, and there were a few blanks that even turbotax didnã¢âât know the answers and i had to spend a few hours searching on wealthfront user forum for the answers.

if you buy an index etf through a regular broker, hold the etf for a year and sell it, you will get 20~30% annual return and there is only 1 entry in your tax form. you know which is better.",3/8/2019 7:33,wealthfront,apple

i called up customer service and the guy didn't even say hello, anyways i told him that i opened my account last week and had sent a message and didn't hear back so calling to check the legitimacy of the customer care. he replied that if you are expecting elaborative customer care then your expectations are not right. he further added that we are not going to reply to your queries immediately and don't expect anyone replying to you in couple of hours.. 

wealthfront - you are not doing any favor to us, if you cant afford elaborative customer care then atleast hire people with basic manners.

investing,1,"i hope you donã¢âât need access to your money from wealthfront in any reasonable timeframe because you would be sol. they donã¢âât support wire transfers so if you need to use that money for buying anything, you need to use ach to transfer it to a checking account, expect 3-4 days and then from your checking, you typically expect it to take 2-3 days on top of that.

investing,1,"i love this bank. great interest rates. 

i donã¢âât really like the app though for a two reasons so far.

1. it is so bloated with all these things i do not need. i just need to see how much money is where and the ability to transfer. that is all. everything else, at least give us the option to hide it. 

2. it is never accurate on showing how much money i really have. the only way wealthfrontã¢ââs app would display an accurate reading of my accountsã¢ââ balances is if i donã¢âât spend a dime for a week. but if youã¢ââre spending money everyday and moving money around and what not, it just takes so long for the app to catch up so the ã¢âânet liquid worthã¢ââ or whatever is always wrong. i like the feature because i can see all my accounts in one place, but it just needs to update way faster.",9/16/2019 16:44,wealthfront,apple

investing,1,"first the good: this app is just plain great, the benefits of consolidating all of my financial information in one central location canã¢âât be understated. having a holistic view of my finances both now and on the horizon helps me keep my finances in good health. investments and liabilities are easy to track and manage, and the ability to add goals/milestones to my financial picture and understand their impacts to my net worth is top notch.

by far my favorite feature is autopilot, which removes all of the guesswork and manual calculations from determining how much money i should allocate to each of my financial ã¢ââbucketsã¢ââ at any given time. this is the feature that sets you apart and makes me love wealthfront. keep up the good work.

the bad: i only have one complaint, but itã¢ââs extremely frustrating to have to continually renew links for institutions iã¢ââve added to wealthfront. some links require renewals on a near daily basis, which i often just end up ignoring, which ultimately prevents wealthfront from providing an accurate display of my current financial picture. this forces me to take wealthfrontã¢ââs numbers/calculations with a grain of salt, because i know the most up to date information often isnã¢âât being used. this is a bummer, because i otherwise love the app.

overall 4 stars because itã¢ââs so easy to use and provides a lot of value with features like path and autopilot, but please continue to work on tightening your integrations with your financial partners so users donã¢âât need to continually renew links that should otherwise be operable.

update: lowering rating to 1 star as iã¢ââm now being asked to manually update links daily. as a user, it should not be my responsibility to update these links on a continuous basis - that is why i use wealthfront, or used to. at this point i might as well log in to each of my financial accounts individually, because itã¢ââs faster than updating through wealthfront, going through 2fa, waiting for the link to authorize, etc. itã¢ââs maddening doing that daily.",2/22/2021 20:29,wealthfront,apple

also, what happened to the index percentages? why would i want to know how much money i have on a given index on a dashboard? absolute numbers are useless to me! where are you testing this ui? in the supermarket? the mall? just because the whole world is your target market doesn't mean they are all going to use the app. in the end are those interested in investments the ones who will continuously read it.

investing,1,"update: kevin finally reached back out to me via email. he told me that in hindsight, i could have prevented any of this from happening, and that as a victim of abuse itã¢ââs too risky for me to have accounts with financial institutions  (i guess he thinks victims of abuse donã¢âât deserve bank accounts?) honestly, i wish i could attach the images of that email. you just canã¢âât make it up.

he also tried to lie and say that itã¢ââs a security necessity at any financial institution to send new address information to someoneã¢ââs old address. considering the fact that i work for a financial institution, i know thatã¢ââs a lie. anyone has the ability to forego sending a confirmation letter to an old address. which i tried to do with stockpile and was told it would be fine. 

so even if what he said wasnã¢âât a lie, his employee nina couldnã¢âât have been more wrong in telling me i had nothing to worry about, and his employees arenã¢âât receiving proper security training. again, stockpile is not a secure app or company.

original:
this is blowing my mind. my abusive ex and stalker sent someone a photo of my mail from stockpile, so i emailed stockpile explaining i didnã¢âât live there anymore and needed to update my address. i explicitly told nina, who spoke to me, that i wanted 0 mail going to that address as they had messed with my finances before.

weeks later the stalker sent a photo of a letter of my address change. the letter literally had my new address right there for him to see. i emailed nina back and she never responded. someone named kevin called and emailed me saying he wanted to provide ã¢ââcontextã¢ââ to the situation. i called back the number he gave and it had been disconnected. so i emailed him again over a week ago and he never responded.

now iã¢ââm scared for my safety over something stockpile did that never should have happened. stockpile is not a secure service and their customer support is worse than non-existent. theyã¢ââve made this situation my worst nightmare and nobody is getting back to me.",9/18/2020 16:14,stockpile,apple

ã¢ââ
hi there, it does look like your transactions failed. these pending charged will drop once your bank process this.

i was only refunded once $500 and no fee $15.99. joelã¢ââs second response was to link my bank, which already is and i have previously purchased stock via stockpile over a year ago, since early 2018.

investing,1,"itã¢ââs an amazing idea, with what would seem to be good intentions on the cover. teach kids about stocks and have them learn how to invest, using their gifted money from birthdays and holidays, or the money they earn from chores and lemonade stands, or having family members buy them gift cards.
so why not do it? cuz itã¢ââs a complete rip off. every transaction, no matter what, costs $1. get $10 gift card from uncle larry and wanna use it to buy camber energy stock? use your card and you only get to keep $7 of your gift, the company takes $3. they take $1 when you buy, and $1 when you wanna sell, and another $1 if you ever want to cash out.
now, heavy hitters will be like, ã¢ââoh, thatã¢ââs not bad at all, my broker charges way moreã¢ââ but, those are people dropping a ton of money, buying a bunch at a time and all that. and they have enough money that they donã¢âât care to burn some. not exactly the thing you wanna teach a kid or new investor. time is money, hard work is money, why waste either? you donã¢âât have to.
robinhood app is a far better option for a number of reasons.
1. its free. wanna buy stock? free. wanna sell stock? free. wanna transfer your earnings out? free. 
2. the interface (app design and easy of use and information given). itã¢ââs way better, more intuitive, looks better, allows you to see all you need to see with little effort. stockpile is lazy design, an adults weak attempt to try and seem simple and appealing on an adolescent scale. looks like the designer of taco bell made it.
3. did i mention itã¢ââs free?

one positive point about stockpile that nobody else offers, they allow you to buy fractions of a share, rather than having to buy an entire share. so uncle larry gave you a $10 gift card, you see on tv this guy talking about sending rockets into space and think he must be cool and super smart, so you wanna invest in his company but find his companyã¢ââs stock price is $268 per share at the moment. not a problem, use your gift card and boom, you own $9 of tesla stock, a tiny fraction of a share. now, tesla climbs its way back up to $300-$340 like it does every 2-3 months...you go to sell cuz thatã¢ââs a profit and you know itã¢ââs gonna go back down towards $260 like it does every 2-3 months. although the value of your partial share went up, if it didnã¢âât go up enough to where your partial share made over $1 profit, you cash out at a loss because stockpile swiped $1.
now, if you bought 10 shares of tesla at $267 today for $2671, and then in june you sell it at $340 getting $3399, then send it to your bank account at $3398 to use as a down payment on a model s, that $3 loss isnã¢âât as noticeable...that is until you see your lottery numbers you usually play hit yesterday and you could have used 1 of those $3 to get a ticket.lol

anyway, itã¢ââs not a terrible app, itã¢ââs a great idea...but imo there are better options and i donã¢âât like giving my money away.",4/5/2019 14:00,stockpile,apple

investing,1,"bought my son $100 in amazon stock and he had nothing but problems setting up an account.  i started to think it was him and told him to come to my house so i could help him.  

what do i discover?  a hugely glitched up and poorly programmed sign up process.  clicked multiple buttons with no response.  after 20 mins of logging back out and going back screens and coming forward, we finally get to where you put in your address.  what happens next? it takes us thirty minutes to figure out why their idiotic site wonã¢âât accept my sonã¢ââs address.  apparently we had to put his apartment number in the same field as his street address despite the fact that they had an actual field for the apartment number(which you canã¢âât use.)
ã°âââ¡ã°âââ¡

so now itã¢ââs 45 mins later and it gets even better.  we now end up at a screen where it wants copies of photo ids.  it wants copies of social security cards.  not a photo id or a soc sec card - but both.  my son didnã¢âât have a soc sec card with him.  at that point we just laughed and gave up for the day.  he said he might try again some other day.

etf investments never did that well over a couple of years, despite strong bull market over period.  a lay persons observation: other investments did much better that were managed by people. growth was up and down and dividends never that great. tax loss harvesting seems overrated when there was a desire is grow value.

it used to be solid with financial links (for years), now fails for two different key institutions for weeks with same message that it is being worked on to correct.  i am wondering what is happening to them as this is unexpected.  i have verified that other financial apps are able to integrate fine.  as a result, i have had to move away from this app, for now at least.",7/20/2020 10:03,wealthfront,apple

$250 withdrawal minimum is pretty steep. i should be able to at least withdraw dividends.

also, being able to choose what day to invest deposited funds would be great too. i understand this is timing the market but through robinhood i've found great success by simply investing when my stocks are down.

path is getting obnoxious, specially to those of us who are trying to build up wealth to survive. there is no point in thinking of retirement if i can't survive the present. there should be an option to hide or disable path.

i can no longer view dividends in the app.

tax season is a pain. why doesn't wealthfront specify what country each dividend came from? 

the only reason i haven't switched to robinhood is because i don't have time to research stocks.",2/28/2018 6:35,wealthfront,apple

investing,2,to start i have been a stock pile user pretty much since they took over from (loyal3 who went under). they were my first real investment firm and at a dollar a trade back then it was a great deal especially with the fractional shares ability. fast forward to present day and thereã¢ââs many many options such as robin hood or fidelity then offer commission free trades with instant access to funds from your bank account. the biggest things that stock pile doesnã¢âât bring to the table is that the trades are not instant because they are used in batches to save them money. this could mean that you lose out on a huge profit potential or even take a huge loss because you donã¢âât really have that instant control. thereã¢ââs also no ability to set a stop loss on any of the stocks which opens you up to increased risk. couple that with the dollar per trade commission and i donã¢âât know what i would be paying for with stockpile anymore as the value proposition just isnã¢âât there. when i expressed these concerns to stockpile they pretty much blew them off as not being important and when i asked to transfer my account out because thereã¢ââs no stop loss they said that i would be charged a fee. my advice is to do your research on other options to trade.,12/21/2020 20:55,stockpile,apple
investing,2,"my children both attempted to redeem stock gift cards from this company and had nothing but problems. the credit did not show up on their accounts. it took me two  emails that went unanswered and two phone calls for a total of 59 minutes on hold before i was able to contact anybody. then the support person wasnã¢âât able to help. she gave me excuses about it being their busy time of year, etc. eventually she transferred me to her supervisor who gave me the same excuses and told me they are having trouble scaling their app, etc. this is a banking organization. they should be aware that they deal with real money and it isnã¢âât acceptable to string people along. 
eventually they were able to get one of my childrenã¢ââs accounts working. it has been more than a week and the other childã¢ââs account still has not been fixed not had there been any contact from the company. i am dreading the reality that i may have to call them again. iã¢ââm certainly n i will be on hold and met with endless excuses.

investing,2,"gonna be honest with you. the app is really only good for a few things. you can basically just buy stocks and watch them grow and have some dividends come in along with it. if you want to actually be involved with your trading this is not the app for you. you canã¢âât really day trade because of how orders are executed. you canã¢âât venture into options, you canã¢âât do forex, you canã¢âât do crypto at all. so if you are a beginner and want to invest in the stock market and then venture into other types of trading you would be better off using robin hood or even etrade. they still have all the account types you may need including custodial accounts. they offer securities and there is no trading commission fees. all around better than what stock pile offers other than the fractional shares part. overall i think you should avoid stockpile. it feels very under equipped especially when you can get an app that offers the same stuff stock pile does with more. i do have some regrets after signing up here.",10/21/2019 16:41,stockpile,apple
investing,2,"one of the more irritating trading apps iã¢ââve used. itã¢ââs really for long term holding - if you plan on getting serious about trading you will very quickly grow out of this appã¢ââs playskool interface and severely limited data displays. donã¢âât plan on doing any time sensitive selling either - your orders donã¢âât get executed until the market close regardless of the price at the time of your order... this means if you try to sell during a plummet, youã¢ââll get the lowest sale price at the end of the day - iã¢ââm admittedly not too familiar with how this is normally supposed to work but iã¢ââm on 3 other exchanges which honor your sell price at the time of the order, so i know it can be done (it should go without saying that there is also no option for stop or limit orders, another serious handicap.) add to this the fact that your sales profit isnã¢âât available to reinvest until the next day, and you will find this app simply provides no agility. the prince of thieves app has this one beat hands down. all of that said, this is a decent app for investing beginners ;-)",2/21/2018 19:17,stockpile,apple
investing,2,"starting with a small investment amount($500) i thought this app would be good. its awful. the only good thing is that you can buy shares in fractions. very small stock selection. no penny stocks (i know theyre volatile, but some people still want to risk it).  when you buy/sell stock, the transactions are not instant, or even quick. you will be forced to buy/sell at end of day pricing so if your stock does well on the first half of the day, you sell, stock bombs, you get screwed and get end of day value. and vise versa for buying. expect 2 business days for buying/selling to process. and then another 3-5 business days to transfer money to your bank. forgo the headache. if youre looking to start investing, robinhood offers far more stocks, no trading-fees, and instant results when buying/selling. robinhood also offers options. and better graphs. just overall better. start there. not here.",6/26/2018 3:29,stockpile,apple
investing,2,"my dad created a custodial account the day before my 18th birthday to gift me stock cause i was interested in the stock market. however, now the problem is turning that account into an individual adult account, which there is no way to do. after emailing the team they suggested to sell off all the stock and create a new account, which created another problem because it wont allow me to create another account with my social security number. so now i cant even use this app with my own money cause of its link to the custodial account, where all the stock purchases ã¢ââneed parent approvalã¢ââ. also i cant add my own bank accounts on the custodial account and use my own money. they need to implement a way to make custodial accounts into individual accounts when the person turns 18, until then, i'm deciding to use other investment apps with better policies.",7/21/2018 2:33,stockpile,apple

itã¢ââs only benefit over robinhood is being able to buy portions of expensive stocks that perform.  but youã¢ââd never know how anything youã¢ââve invested in is doing in real time.  itã¢ââs basically an investorã¢ââs side hack for loose change.  iã¢ââm sure stockpileã¢ââs argument would be ã¢ââbut itã¢ââs only .99 a trade!ã¢ââ   yeah and you clearly get what you pay for...kinda!  which is why rh is the superior product.  itã¢ââs free.",3/17/2018 17:02,stockpile,apple

investing,2,"this app is good for small long term investments, however iã¢ââve had nothing but problems. at first it took 3 weeks to get started followed by waiting 3-5 days for money to get transferred from your bank account. when you want to buy a share, you have $1 fee and another $1 fee to sell. it also takes 1-3 days to buy a stock. if you bought a stock for $150 and it goes up to $200 by the time you buy it, you would buy in for $200. this is the sam for selling, if you sell a stock for $200 and it goes down to $170 by the time it sells, you sell the share for $170 minimizing your profits.",2/2/2021 14:44,stockpile,apple
investing,2,"so yes itã¢ââs easy.  however....  there are a few things that makes this app not worth it.  first itã¢ââs 99 cents to trade.   second they charge an extra $3 if you pay by credit card or apple pay.  if you pay by debit, they charge 1.5 percent with a minimum of 75 cents.  you can get it transferred free from your checking account but it takes 3 days.   

so if youã¢ââre doing minor investing at $25 a week, youã¢ââd have to pay up to 29$ for the transaction.  in my 2 years experience now with the app itã¢ââs taken almost that full time to earn that extra money back.

investing,2,i started an account and for the most part the app is good. the problems i have come across though is 1) shares are purchased and sold at end of the trade day instead of at time of order. which could cause major losses for a person.. 2) chat support takes more than a week to respond and phone support puts you on hold for hours. ( not exaggerated ).. 3) i placed an out going funds transfer to my bank. the faqã¢ââs section says 3 business days. as of now it has been well over a week and still no deposit made back to my bank account.,2/1/2018 13:05,stockpile,apple
investing,2,they offer you gift cards instead of cash back on cancelled stock purchases. kind of lame. so now to get my money back(for an order that was cancelled before it even got the chance to be completed) i have to redeem the stock that i donã¢âât want and then attempt to sell it to get money back into my account. idk it just seems kind of complicated and the .99 cent fees per purchase are pretty lame. and thereã¢ââs credit card charges. so if youã¢ââre working with like 20 bucks this isnã¢âât really for you ..,5/29/2018 4:52,stockpile,apple

investing,2,"i'm unsure of this. i wanted to test the waters with this stock app and i'm not too happy with it.   so for the pros: it has a great layout. it appears to be very beginner friendly and has a lot of information for learning more about stocks and trading. i love the idea of educating others to be more financially conscious. though it lacks in much of everything else.   the cons: being a mobile app, the buttons don't work at all. i tried to set up my account to link to my bank and no matter how many times i clicked on the ""banking"" button, nothing would happen. it wasn't until some time later i clicked a bit above the button and it went to link to my bank account. but by then it was too late as i was no longer interested in the app. the fact that you are charged .99 usd for purchasing and selling stock that won't become available until the end of day really disturbs me but perhaps because it's not intended on being a platform for stock trading but for long term investment? i'm unsure. however i really am bothered that i can't sell my stock in the case of a bad pr for a company or buy in the case of seeing a good opportunity until the end of day.   there are many other stock/investment platforms that can deliver what you are looking for but at the moment ""stockpile"" does not deliver.",2/23/2018 15:40,stockpile,google
