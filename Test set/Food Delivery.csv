Food Delivery,1,"ordered a couple of drinks(alcoholic) and the typical process is you receive a confirmation text, then a courtesy call from the driver that theyâre on the way, and sometimes another call when they arrive outside because they have to personally hand them to you and scan your id since theyâre handing over alcohol to you. 

youâd think because youâve ordered plenty times before its be the same process, but no. i ordered some beer and was told theyâd deliver my order by a certain time. no biggie, i can wait. but as the time was approaching and they was no heads up on the drivers end, i chose to open the app and track their distance. they were on the way it said. waited and waited, even 20 minutes past the time they gave, and the driver was still âon the wayâ. i had no number to reach the driver. i had to just accept the cancellation of my order i emailed gopuff about the entire situation only to be surprised by their response. in a condensed version they said: we asked the driver and you couldnât provide an id so the order was cancelled. i even have screen shots of my call logs and texts. i tried going back onto the app to see if there was another method to get help, and they disabled my account. doesnât seem like they care about referrals. iâll start telling all the people i referred to begin deleting gopuff from their phone. if you canât take care of your customers, you donât deserve new ones. 

so in short i was charged for nothing",6/8/2021 17:16,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,1,"this app is such a joke. with the false advertising shown for offering alcohol and everything else available to users, in reality itâs only offered to like 3 cities all throughout america. a complete waste of time signing up and giving away all my personal information for them to sell. they donât even tell you where they are able to deliver to before signing up, you have to put in your address to find out. this app is a disgusting information leach. in order to sign up which is a waste of time because youâre not going to be able to buy alcohol anywhere anyway (unless youâre in the 3 major cities they deliver it to) you must give away all your personal info. including phone number, email address, the right to see and download all your google account email addresses, see and download your exact date of birth, see and  download your street address, see and download your personal phone numbers. after all of this, then the app will tell you if theyâre able to deliver to you. such a disgusting terrible app. i donât see why this app would deserve anything more than 2 stars with such terrible lies it says. alcohol is in the name of this app! and it only delivers alcohol to 3 cities! what is this! worst app ever!",6/14/2021 18:12,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,1,"extremely rude customer service. orders get forgotten. drivers show up almost two hours late. now, even though the checkout page has an option for âcontact-less delivery, leave outside door,â they refuse to and argue with you.

on more than one occasion, they have just left with my order without canceling it until i called customer service, and was told 3-5 day refund and that theyâd figure out about the contactless delivery option, since itâs regional. it should be standard. every other delivery app has this and iâve never had problems.

 not to mention their selection is insanely limited to begin with, and then over half of the items are consistently out of stock for days. and i mean regular groceries, not like hand sanitizer and toilet paper back in april 2020.  they are also egregiously overpriced (paid $6 for a bottle of tums expecting the usual size and got a miniature that came with eight tums.â i paid the extra in the past because the sheer convenience made up for it. now itâs like iâm paying for literally substandard products and twice their cost and awful customer service.  stick with instacart and postmates. gopuff does not have their act together.",1/14/2021 3:25,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,1,"iâve been using gopuff for an entire year now, and iâm done. they have problems with delivering food at a reasonable time, hiring trustworthy people, and delivering food that isnât expired. when you first place your order, the app will give you an estimate of when your food will arrive. typically, the estimate is 30 minutes to an hour which is way too long for someone who lives downtown in a large city (meaning there should be more gopuff drivers available and near), but whatever. my problem is that they will keep changing the estimate when you check in on your order; it will go from 30 minutes to 45 minutes, and so forth. one time, i actually waited two hours for $15 worth of food. my final straw with this company came from receiving expired food. iâve received expired food and stale items three of four times now, but i never complained. however, about two weeks ago, the last time i ever bought anything wrong them, i received food that was expired by an entire week and i let the company know. two weeks later, they havenât gotten back to me. no compensation, no apology, just silence. itâs pathetic, honestly. take your money to doordash or ubereats, people.",1/29/2019 4:14,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,i put in my order and wait was about an hour. no big deal. an hour had passed and it still said it was being packed. this was weird as i only ordered a pint of ice cream and 2 bags of chips and it was 3 am. i called and wasnât given any help other than being told my items were actually already packed but it would take an hour. again this was weird as i already waited more than an hour from the time originally given for the delivery and the place they do the shipping from is literally up the street from my place. the guy on the phone sounded uninterested and at the end of the day i just canceled the order. this was the worst experience iâve ever had from delivery services and as much as i like rooting for the new guy and showing new businesses support gopuff will not be receiving any support or orders from me ever again. all in all the 2 hours i waited and the additional hour they insisted i wait on was a complete waste of time and by the time i realized their negligence it was already too late to go to any store nearby. if zero stars were an option iâd choose it but unfortunately iâll have to give 1 star,8/15/2019 3:24,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"i am a freshman in college and i thought this app was a great idea until i actually downloaded it. if this app was made for college students to buy snacks, the snacks on the app should be in bulk. what college student buys one to two bags of chips at a time? if we do that we would run out of food way too quick and would just have to order more in maybe a day or two. when i was ready to have some food items and other things delivered, i checked this app out and found myself disappointed that they only allow you to buy singular items for the most part. after i left this app, i found that walmart has a delivery service, so i used that app instead because walmart is a huge supermarket that has anything that anyone needs. it is a taxing $8 delivery, but i think it is very worth it if you buy enough snacks/groceries to last you months, or even an entire semester. i do however like the idea of gopuff offering items such as toiletries, household goods, etc; but walmart does it better. iâd say if you are in college, or even anyone who wants to have items like these delivered, walmart does it better.",1/26/2019 14:41,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"i have never had a good experience with gopuff. any time iâve ordered it tells me it will be there in about 2 hours, which is insane. it will always be late, and i never receive the correct items because theyâll be out of stuff and either substitute it with random things or just wonât give me anything at all. i keep giving it chances because itâs really convenient to be able to get snack food when everything is closed, but the final straw was today when the delivery driver was late and made me cross a road with my cane then carry heavy bags back across it. they put 2 cases of drinks in a single bag and it ripped in the middle of the street. instead of helping he just drove away. it would be one thing if it was a single delivery driver, but iâve never had such a bad experience with a company ever. iâve never ever felt the need to write a bad review before, but if youâre thinking about using this service, donât. youâll wait hours for your food just for it to arrive melted, shaken up, or not at all.",3/10/2020 1:31,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,1,"the first time i used this app (to order maybe 4 things, including frozen items) my order arrived two hours late, with frozen items thawed. after receiving an apology email regarding the âunusually long wait timeâ we decided to order again, only to have our second experience end worse. our delivery driver didnât show up after an hour. so we checked the app to find that it stated our order had been âdelivered.â we checked outside to see if maybe our driver had just left it on our doorstep without calling, to find nothing. 

after contacting customer service via phone, i spoke to someone who offered to redispatch our order. we asked for a full refund and will allegedly receive it in 24-48 hours. however, the email apology we received from the âhomie hotlineâ was entirely unprofessional, unhelpful, and almost more frustrating than not receiving the order in the first place. we will not be using this app again and recommend anyone tempted should just take the 5-10 minute walk to cvs or shawâs themselves rather than deal with the headache.",4/14/2019 0:26,gopuff,Apple

so yeah. my box of cookies are damp and my ice cream is a bag of mush. but at least i got my order? 5 hours after the promised time??? like i was willing to wait but not that long. 
if youâre struggling to find drivers or if you know drivers are gonna be scarce in my area, just tell me. iâm not even asking for a refund because i was already given a credit and i did technically get my stuff, but itâs not even worth it anymore.",2/23/2022 11:52,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,1,their customer service is by far the worst i have ever encountered. i only ordered once from them and had emailed them with two separate issues. first being i never received the $20 credit i was supposed to. i emailed their customer service and had a back and forth exchange until i received an email that the issue would be looked over and i would hear back within 24-48 hours. i never received a follow up email. the other issue was that i checked my bank statements and my card was charged for an order i never placed. again i reached out and received an email that it would be looked into and that i should hear back within 24-48 hours. i never received a follow up email. i work in customer service and this is by far the worst customer service line i have dealt with.,3/22/2020 16:17,gopuff,Apple

almost every delivery driver placed my food six stories above me in the lobby (our building is on a hill, front entrance is 6th floor) or on the sidewalk, where it gets stolen immediately in my neighborhood. 

when i called to complain several times, they were verbally abusive and called me âlazyâ and âfatâ (iâm not overweight and am recovering from an injury). 

grubhub, ubereats, instacart have always/every time have followed my directions (i buzz them in the building door, they take the elevator, leave food safely outside my apartment door).

the few times they did come to my door. they refused to leave the food and wanted to see me. i guess to humiliate me and see my injury? i donât know. i donât care.

Food Delivery,1,"if you order alcohol as far as two hours before 11pm, they wonât pack your order or cancel it or anything and it will never come. they just ignore it because they canât be bothered to actually deliver it since if they just wait until 11 it would be illegal. and even if they do actually decide to complete the order, expect it to take at the very least an hour. thank god there are other apps for this. 

in their help center, they conveniently leave out an option for what to do if the order never arrives. which is one of the most obvious things a delivery service would have in a help center. they couldnât make themselves look worse if they tried. 

apparently they also cant be bothered to update whatâs in or out of stock on the app either. so 2 out of 3 times you place an order expect to get a call saying they donât actually have an item in stock. and even if you do get your order, something will definitely be missing.",1/27/2020 1:03,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"this service is absolute garbage, i had to call customer service twice and never received my order after placing it on two separate occasions and they refuse to deliver to me. i was signed up for their subscription service, but cancelled after they said there was no way they could help me out through phone support. that being said, their appâs appearance is very dated and uses cringe inducing graphics and emojis. terrifying, overpriced, horrific, avoid at all costs.",4/7/2019 21:54,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,itâs a nice concept especially in the time of a global pandemic but the delivery is so slow. every time i order from this app it takes over an hour to get to my door. itâs impossible to tell where your order is geographically and the estimated delivery window is usually a 40 minute range which gives me no information on when i can actually expect the order to arrive.,5/3/2020 2:56,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,1,ordered 5 items and they only had 2 of them in stock. i was called after the order for them to tell me this even though the app said they were in stock. they asked to swap them for other items and i was the one who had to ask if there was a price difference. delivery time is about 1 hour which is far from the 15-30 mins that was advertised and guaranteed by their promo teams.,11/28/2021 2:51,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"i just got off the phone with a girl who was very rude and hateful. she was nice at first. i had a very late order delivered to me several days ago. i called about it and  i had the nicest customer service person ever. she gave me a $25 credit. i went to use it this evening and it was only $7. i called customer service because it wasnât showing up in my account. in the beginning, i was speaking with this girl that was very nice until i called her out about the $25 credit i was given. she had listened to the phone call. itâs right there in the phone call where you can hear the girl gave me a $25 credit. this girl got snippy with me. i got hateful right back. she threatened something about me being unprofessional (i donât work there) so that was silly. i told her she needed to clean her ears out better because i know what was said on that call where the girl gave me $25. i ended up hanging up on her. a customer should not have to deal with someone like that. earlier on the call, she was trying to get around that $25 credit. i did get a text and am going to retrieve it from my account if possible. good thing i keep all my messages. i order from this company frequently. if this was my company i would never allow any customer to be treated as i was. please copy and paste this on any feedback site about this company. there is other competition out there that will gladly take my money and if there is a problem most companies stand behind their word. do yourself a favor and order from somewhere else. i would hate for anyone else to deal with what i just dealt with.  i know what credit i was told because it honestly surprised me. i had fixed dinner and waited over two hours for that delivery. i ordered something to go with dinner. taking over 2 hours is ridiculous. supposedly there was bad weather. it wasnât that bad because my 80-year old mother and been out driving that evening.  i wish companies taught their employees better customer service because this girl shouldnât have a job after talking to me the way she did. this is definitely not a stand-up company. i will be sharing this review everywhere possible.",3/8/2021 3:37,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"the company pays its drivers a flat rate of $3 per delivery, no matter how far away you live from the warehouse or how small/large your order is. they are so focused on making sure their customers are happy that they completely overlook the well-being of their drivers, who are doing all the work. they need to communicate to the customers that the pay structure is really low and assumes the tip will be at least $3. as a driver, i am constantly making deliveries to people who literally do not tip. at all. that is just rude and inconsiderate. especially because they order in the middle of the night, during bad weather, and then donât tip. itâs as if they donât understand that the drivers donât make more when itâs late or itâs snowing or they have to go to a bad neighborhood and walk around in the dark looking for an address. i have zero respect for this company. they can get away with treating their drivers so badly because there will always be new drivers to take that place. itâs appalling and i know they are breaking the law. drivers are not even making minimum wage and thatâs before gas and taxes. so if you choose to use this service you should keep all that in mind and show some kindness to the people slaving away for your benefit. and to the company, congrats on figuring out how to make millions by getting people to work for you for almost nothing. itâs quite a remarkable business model and pretty much evil at the end of the day.",2/20/2021 17:43,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"iâve had some successes ordering from gopuff but there are a couple of big issues i have that will stop me from keeping this on my phone:

1) my last order was large and included alcohol and snacks. the driver came with less than half of what i ordered and getting a refund was tedious. she couldnât get in touch with driver support and when i called the next day, the support agent i spoke to could not wrap her head around a partially fulfilled order. she kept asking âso you did receive the order then?â not all of it! it was painful to get support and wasted more time than it would have taken to just get the items myself.

2) the app will assault you on a regular basis with notifications. thereâs no way to turn off ad notifications in the app. this is irritating because turning off all notifications is the only option, and that includes order update notifications too. having this app installed means ads in your notification at least once per day. theyâre not even useful notifications like sales or offers â theyâre just random things you could buy like cookies or groceries. as long as gopuff is installed, get used to a persistent ad notification that seems to come back every time you dismiss it.

3) delivery times are horribly inconsistent. i was amazed at first when orders came quickly. then after using the app 3-4 more times, i realized it wasnât the norm. i ordered alcohol for a gathering of friends and it didnât come for 3 hours despite advertising fast delivery times. this service just isnât reliable.

4) when signing up for a free trial of their premium subscription offering, i expected some kind of notification or email when the trial ended. i forgot and realized iâd been billed for several months. this is partly my fault for not paying attention to the settings, but i still think itâs a decent thing to do to let your subscribers know when theyâre going to be charged. apple subscriptions all do this. gopuff does not.",11/25/2021 18:19,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"the app concept is really great. i love the selection of items, the pricing, and the speedy delivery. however, have been unable to place orders for 4 days and gopuff support has not fixed the issue. i encountered a glitch where it would process my order but nothing would go through. sunday night i called support who told me they would submit a ticket and get back to me that night or the next day. nothing. so i called again monday afternoon, and they submitted another ticket and promised a prompt follow up. nothing again! so i sent an email monday night, received an automated message that i'd be contacted within 24 hours. nothing. i sent a follow up on tuesday, and then on wednesday i finally got an email back that said ""can you describe the problem to us?"" what? my first email was very detailed already and i attached a screen recording. i replied by copy and pasting my first email to them which was enough information to look into the issue. clearly my first email was ignored.

they have given me multiple excuses for why i can't place orders; its my app (even though i showed in my screen recording that even the website doesn't work), its an account issue so they need to delete my account then make a new one, then they said it's a finance glitch on their end and it's going to take a long time to fix since multiple accounts have this issue. 

it's thursday now and there has been no clear answers as to whats wrong or how it will be fixed. every staff member (except for the delivery drivers) seems stoned, aloof, or about to fall asleep. 

on top of that, i keep getting promotional emails that the unsubscribe link doesn't work to. i emailed the support team about this and they have not even acknowledged my request to be removed from the email list. 

overall this app is beautiful in concept and design but is poorly managed and has so many errors.",9/30/2021 18:36,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"two major strikes before i have even ordered anything. i live in an apartment building, and i have not been able to get the app to accept my actual address no matter what i have tried. where my unit is, it overlooks the empty lot next door, at the back of my building, and the app *insists* on using that address instead of my actual one. it has also popped up the address of the building *across the street.* it absolutely will *not* accept my manual input of my actual address. the correct address does show in my list of addresses - but as soon as i switch back to the home page view to start an order, boom, the delivery address changes right back to whatever tf the app decides to make it.

then i just discovered that it isnât even optimized for ipad. it is the year 2020 - not exactly the early days of the ios ecosystem - and the only thing i see on my ipad when i open the app is the *iphone* app, in portrait orientation only. wtaf?? like millions of other people, i use my ipad in landscape orientation because of the larger keyboard, and because thatâs how it works best with the cover/stand i have. i do not appreciate having to either twist my neck around to see an iphone app, or to have to actually turn the whole ipad around in this day and age.

not feeling kindly towards this app and service right now at all, especially after reading some of the very negative reviews.

if they fix at least the address issue, i may still try the service, but my initial interest has simply flown out the window.",4/29/2020 9:31,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"it was nice at first. the convenience was awesome and the hours were reasonable, not to mention the options. once gopuff decided to give back to their customers, they started doing promotions. the ben and jerryâs ice cream deal start at $8 and some change so $9 basically which you were required to spend before getting the free ice cream(which was fine since you had to spend $9 in order to place an order). that price has steadily risen to $20! thereâs no excuse for that price on a deal that only lasts one day. the rise in price happened steadily over one year. itâs not inflation, gopuff has transitioned into a money based company instead of one based in customer service. also, theyâve never cared about their lower income customers, who can only pay in cash. they only except card, which makes no sense for a warehouse stocked company. itâs not like uber eats where they have to go to the restaurant and pick it up with the money you gave them, so you should be able to pay cash.

a disgrace. iâve ordered 8 times from gopuff totaling over $100 and barely have enough points to add 4 lindor chocolates or a kind bar. iâd have to spend another hundred in order to get a personal sized bag of chips. at least give us a family sized lays chips. they honestly never shouldâve added this feature, itâs insulting to my intelligence and no where near an incentive to return. i can get better deals with grocery store delivery. 

in conclusion, i have no faith that gopuff will start caring about their customers. iâm going to actively let people i know of gopuffs indifference. keep an eye out in rva and vb if you live there i have friends on several radio shows that have nothing better to report about.",7/22/2019 6:40,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"i was really excited to be able to order groceries and snacks instead of a whole meal... the first time i ordered was black friday. i work at the mall, so it took a while for my delivery guy to find parking (obvi.) and he was super nice. only took about 30 minutes, so i was okay considering that he had to find an open spot and claw past the sea of customers inside the mall. 
today i ordered at 8am, as soon as they delivery hours started. five items, no big deal. the delivery time said 10-11 minutes after i submitted my order. i ordered at 8:03... by 8:45, the delivery time still said â7 minutesâ, and there was no way to contact the delivery driver. i called the customer service twice, once to have them check in the order and one a few minutes later to cancel the order. nearly an hour and a half later (after i cancelled the order), i got a text from the driver saying they were here. by that time, i had already walked out to go get coffee and a bagel from a nearby coffee shop and was nearly done eating. i love the concept, but they need to make some major changes to the system and give an accurate delivery time. i wonât be ordering from this service anymore... convenience is only convenient when itâs done right.",12/6/2018 17:08,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"first, i ordered and it was cancelled because they didn't have enough drivers. suddenly, he called and said he was by the door. they'd normally have it sent up to my doorstep so i'd assume that they would have done it anyway. i requested if he could come up, he said no. so i went down, called back and asked where he was. he wasn't even by the total wine doors. i called and asked where he was, then he snapped and sounded annoyed as he answered that he was in the other entrance. he then proceeded to hang up on my call before i could even finish talking. sure, i was taking a little more time to walk from one entrance to the other, but that's no way to treat your client. he wasn't even waiting by the doors when i got there and was waiting in the car. of course i wasn't gonna tip him for his horrible service. he then texted and said that i can't order from gopuff again? don't worry. i don't even want to use this app anymore. i urge all of you to stay away from this kind of horrible service, please do yourself a favor and use postmates or something else instead.",6/17/2017 5:21,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,1,"we were charged 3 times, attempted to be stolen from, threatened with a police call, and the driver sexually harassed my girlfriend via text

my girlfriend and i ordered some snacks on halloween. a card was on file in the app, but it somehow rang through as a âcash purchaseâ. the driver delivered to us, asked for cash, told us we could hang on to the order and switch it over to a card order. he left, our card order went through, and 10 minutes later he came back, knocked on the door and asked for the order back, threatening to get the cops involved. he didnât bother to check headquarters first to see if we paid, which we did. he called them after threatening us to find out that we did indeed pay, then he shamefully said âyou guys are chillâ and walked away. wasnât helpful and was very aggressive.
the next day, nov 1st, my girlfriend filed a report, texted the driver asking for a name, to which she was told âmr. sexy pantsâ by an employee. also, she found out her card was charged three times on the app, and the driver was asking for cash payment. scam.

Food Delivery,1,"poorly conceived convenience coupled with sophomoric innuendos and a close time of 0420, leads this app, and its legal team, wrought for doom. 
i first encountered this late night grocery store through a third party vendor. after not receiving my desert from a previous meal, i thought this the perfect app for my sweet tooth. after my order arrived, the marketing items contained within my delivery gave way to a rouse that will be short-lived. pharmaceutical cannabinoids, made under strict fdca monitoring, have been used with great success for very specific therapeutic areas. combustible tobacco is controlled to some extent; however, the promotion of unregulated vaporized nicotine should be discouraged until the contents of the amount of nicotine liquid as well as the 'vapor' emitted are scrutinized and approved as for use at-risk. my second order via this app sealed the deal. my sweets never arrived on time and i sought rest. calls and texts to the publicized numbers on the app and sister website have gone unanswered. the excellent reviews of this app are rather uniform in nature wreak of insider promotion. get thee (and this app) to a nunn'ry . . .",10/11/2014 23:57,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"i needed one simple item: tortilla chips. the app already gave me my first disappointment when i searched for regular old tostitoâs and santitaâs and on the border tortilla chips but only found this expensive grain-free brand of tortilla chips (six dollars for five ounces??). fine whatever. but then i went to check out and learned i had to have seven dollars in my cart to have it delivered âon demand.â isnât the whole point of this app to have snack craving delivered to you when you order it? even postmates doesnât have something so ridiculous tacked onto it.

i got over my reservations and placed my order but immediately regretted it when i saw the estimated delivery time was for an hour later. itâs one thing not tell you the deliver time ahead of your order so you know how long you have to be available, but an hour to deliver two measly, prepackaged items? insane. postmates doesnât even take that long for fresh food. 

so here i am hating everything about this app and wanting to cancel this order, but as if i donât despise this app enough, there is no help center, no way to cancel, no number to call, no way to contact the driver or shopper in case you slipped up in your order... they donât care about their own app or the customers. lord only knows how they treat their obvious lack of employees. itâs a money grab.

Food Delivery,1,"donât bother. while this app has a clever idea and an appealing business model for the average college student, my experiences have been far below subpar. 
take a look at the other reviews. notice how a large majority of people never receive their orders, or it takes ages. this has happened to me twice. first time we ordered a few beers and our waiting time clocked into nearly two and half hours. then just a few days ago we tried again with a bottle of wine. we ordered around 10:30...the order did not come until 12:15. at that point, we didnât even want it anymore. when calling, we were hung up on 2-3 times before someone picked up. 
if gopuff can get their sh** together, deliver things quickly, allow a customer to see where their delivery is in real time, and have a more reliable phone number, i would have no trouble imaging that theyâd be big. until then, me, and no one else for that matter, is going to wait hours for their products.",6/26/2018 22:05,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,1,"go puff has a great concept and idea but wow itâs not up to par just yet. i called in twice, once to initially cancel because i received a message stating that it would be a delayed. all i ordered was a soda and ice cream. representation told me that after the initial 30 minute wait the delay could be up to 90 additional minutes which by that time, i might as well go get it myself. i waited 1.5 hours for two items and the when the driver called. he said that he was at the location of where i wanted it to be delivered and he clearly wasnât as i was waiting at the door. driver began to say i was incorrect even though i asked whatâs around him and he was approx 10 blocks away from me. he was being a bit rude and it rubbed me the wrong way and i decided to not bicker but to just go ahead and cancel the order.

Food Delivery,1,"first time writing an app review but i felt it was very necessary. it may be a local issue with the seattle location however, i've used the app about 10 times and have only gotten my delivery on time once. i would understand a 10-15 minute delay but these delays are an additional 90 minutes on top of the 30 minute wait time. so it a total of two hours instead of their advertised 30 minutes. i always call their location to see what the problem is and every time the excuse is that they are short staffed because a driver is sick. funny how that happens every night. please be honest about delivery times because ordering something for 9pm and getting it close to midnight is highly inconvenient.",5/14/2017 5:44,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,1,"update the delivery range on the app. iâve tried ordering twice and while i understand kinks in new apps and services, this is something that should have been addressed before opening. 

first time the excuse was the weather which was fully understandable! exactly why i wasnât going out! but the second time the excuse was not being able to provide services to my area as of yet even though the app shows they deliver to my area. 

again fully understandable things are fully developed yet but a better situation is trying to order and automatically not being able to. that way hopes arenât raised. at this point even when delivery is available for my area i wonât be using this business. nor will i recommend this app/business. iâm sure me and my few friends wonât affect anything. especially since there are so many happy customers. 

while they win for being one of the first to provide  this service, iâm sure they wonât be the only option soon. and hopefully other options will be more prepared before opening for business.",12/19/2017 13:59,gopuff,Apple

20$ order",12/31/2018 6:36,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,1,"i ordered from the app only twice and thereâs multiple reasons why i uninstalled it after the second. so one reason is the order time is ridiculous. iâm usually pretty lax when it comes to wait times but when the app says 20-30 minutes and it takes 2:30 hours, i wonât put up with it. next, we live on a block with only three houses, so the driver had my number to call incase he was lost or anything like that. he instead 1. he pulls up with music blaring (our house is close to a highway so itâs pretty decently sound proof) and at 1:30 am, that definitely irritated me. next, instead of calling to see which house was the right one, he goes and knocks on both neighbors doors! 
the last thing that was the last straw was random charges after ordering on the app. the first time, i had a random $4 charge which didnât really bother me and i thought that i went somewhere and forgot about getting something. but the next time i order, i have one $43 charge and a $36 charge for what i find out to be porn websites. you may think that iâm blaming the app for some weird thing i have going on but iâll explain why iâm pretty sure it was the app. 1. i had just gotten paid and just went to work then home. there were no other charges besides the random two plus the gopuff ones. i still thought that was a reach but then i thought about how the only two times i got charged randomly, it was when i orders through the app. iâm a generally paranoid person so if i do have to hand off my card, i keep a close eye on it for the reason the numbers donât get stolen. next, i disputed the charges with my bank and thatâs when i come to find out the charges were on porn (on my bank statements, it was just a weird link to a random website iâve never even been to) plus i live in wheat ridge and the address where the charges were made in pueblo, and if you know colorado, thatâs a decent ways away. sorry for such a long review but i donât want anyone else going through what i did plus since i deleted the app, i got a new card plus have not had any random charges since then so it could either just be a random person got my card number somehow but iâm 100% sure it had something to do with the app.",11/21/2018 17:16,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,1,"this company has one of the worst customerâs service department i have ever seen. i had the disgrace of downloading this app because the advertisement was overwhelming. when i did the promise looked simple, so i went through the different options of items, made a cart and tried to order something. in order to order something you have to register (no worries, i donât really care) but in order to register you have to verify a phone number. i tried with multiple phones numbers, different cellular companies and even different states with different phone numberâs areas. the verification message would never come through. usually companies like this have a phone call option as well in case something goes wrong, they refuse to even take this into consideration. 

i had to contact the âcustomer serviceâ department. first, they would all speak such a bad english. so informal, speaking with âghetto languageâ and then being clearly annoyed if you ask to repeat. then i had to wait for over an hour in hold while âthey figured it outâ ... they disconnected the call. called again, had to start from beginning, was in hold again for a good while, disconnected. called one last time, refused to start from beginning so was transferred to another department, which took them a good 15 minutes to do so, in which they made me start again explaining everything. after a while and trying to see what the error was they said that was my phoneâs fault. i clarified i have tried with multiple phones. then they decided to blame it on the phone company, clarified again that i tried with multiple phone in different phone companies. since he didnât know whatâs going on, put me in hold and...guess? yes, disconnected.

Food Delivery,1,"i first tried this app a week ago and i was so excited. iâm in college so i donât have a car and all of my friends wanted ice cream and one of them suggested this app, despite never having used it. iâve used other delivery apps so i wasnât skeptical or anything. so we ordered $35 worth of ice cream, coming out of my account by the way. anyway, we waiting and i knew it would take awhile but the eta notification thing kept changing randomly. it would go from 40 minutes to 20, then 5 minutes to 10. at this point, itâs been an hour since i ordered and still nothing. so, i call the number that was sent to me and i ask what the exaxt eta is, because it had already passed the time it said it would take. the lady couldnât give me an answer because apparently the man hadnât picked up my items yet and he hadnât âprioritizedâ anything. anyway, so i just said i wait some more, i didnât want to be difficult, it was late. so, i wait almost another hour and by then, it had been 2 hours since i ordered 5 little pints of ice cream. i call again and request for my order to be cancelled. the man said that it would take 3-5 business days and it was technically monday (at like 1-2 oâclock). so i assumed iâd have my $35 back by friday. no biggie. the only problem was that the entire week and next weekend went by and i still didnât see the money back in my account. i call this monday afternoon and the lady i spoke with say the request for a refund was never put in...she asked who i spoke with, but i didnât remember the guys name, unfortunately. iâm still waiting for the money to be refunded. itâs thursday. letâs just say i and no one else i know will be using gopuff, ever again.",10/4/2018 14:50,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"i will no longer use your service until you start treating your drivers better. you have cut their weekly bonuses, you have cut their subsidized pay, and you have made it hard for them to get shifts every week. you have posted record profits and secured billions of dollars from investors. yet even during a pandemic you did not even pay your drivers more. the temporary subsidy for a few months does not count. that was long after the pandemic had started and was dying down. multiple drivers have contracted covid-19 while working for you and had to scan the idâs of customers who were sick. you still did not pay them more for the hazard that they endured. you tried with offering sick pay if drivers did get sick so iâll give you that, but that did t help those who took the risk. you charge your customers $1.95 delivery fee and brag about how amazing it is, but what you donât tell them is that you pay your drivers to 2.50 per order and of that $1.95 is being paid by the customer. in addition to that the customer pays the tip and any other fees you tack on. so basically you pay $.55 a delivery to your drivers with the exception of customers that have âfamâ and basically pay their delivery fees up front . fam is a joke and only worth it if you order multiple times a week. also, with the exception of the pathetic weekly bonus you are now offering. $45 for 90 orders completed a week? it used to be $110 for 90 orders and even more at other locations? letâs talk about âtier 2 deliveriesâ, you actually expect your drivers to travel 30 mins+ or more to complete a delivery, and not pay them more then $2.50? with the possibility of no tip? some of these locations are in the middle of nowhere or dangerous areas and you have women driving at night. yâall donât care. you save millions of dollars by passing off the cost of owning a fleet to your drivers. commercial insurance, fleet maintenance, gas, etcâ¦.are not cheap. donât even get me started on taxes. you screw the little guy. thatâs one of your dirty little secrets along with the the rides haling companies. are you all still throwing away excess food and claiming you have it to charity on your taxes? because the smell outside of your warehouses during he summer is horrible. you all guard your dumpsters like a prison. i wonder why. youâd think you would just give it to your starving drivers like you used too. at least then your property wouldnât smell. you all have got to be the cheapest multi billion dollar corporation on the planet maybe next to amazon. but wait that makes sense because didnât you guys just hire some guy from amazon? funny how all of these problems and the pay cuts for drivers started when he started at gopuff? coincidence? i think not. when you all are left with nothing but crap drivers who provide your customers with crap service maybe then youâll realize you screwed up. until then i will no longer use your service and i will no longer encourage my friends and family to use your service or contract with you. i am absolutely sick of hearing about companies like you, uber, lyft pop, doordash, grubhub, instacart etc. screwing over the people who bust their butt for you. shame on all of you! #gopuffyourself canât wait to boycott your ipo!",11/29/2021 6:42,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"on sunday july 25th, i had a horrible experience with a driver. i placed an order of delicious snacks and wine with a sick child in my lap. mommy needed a break. and thanks to hulu, i discovered gopuff. all was well with the world! 

iâve always had a lovely experience with gopuff! it's incredible how fast the drivers arrive and how pleasant the app is to use. the entire experience is well thought out and up to this pointâ well executed. 

with my sick child in my lap, i placed this order and worked on my laptop per my normal (aside from the sick kid part). i kept hearing my phone ping with notifications. this driver appeared to be lost. i reiterated my location details with him and went as far as sending a picture of my front doorâ¦ which of courseâ¦ woke my sick kid. 

i get him back to sleep, and continue to get more notifications from this driver and notice that i have missed calls from an unknown number. (my phone silences unknown calls by default). **plus iâve never had to talk to a driver before***nor could iâ¦ iâm in the middle of work with a sleeping child in my lap.?!?!?!

having missed the calls, i text the driver back. but now he wants me to meet him at my leasing center? thats over a mile away from my apartment. what is this? who gets treated like this? if i wanted to drive a mile plus, i would have gone to the cvs, walmart, or 7-11 thats right up the street from me.

also, its just past 11:30 at night. iâm a small woman. and a survivor of domestic abuse. this hits a nerve. it feels as if some strange man is trying to lure me from my apartment. 

on a serious note, this is completely unacceptable. iâm a frequent user of door dash, uber eats, instacart, and favor. out of all of these, gopuff became my recent favorite due to its delivery speed.  (i have a busy life between running a practice, 2 businesses and a family). never have i ever been asked to leave my apartment. never before have i had any sort of issue like this. 

i immediately felt unsafe. i promptly got on a chat with customer service. 30 seconds later this driver cancels my order. in spite of all the details he had on meâ including an actual picture of my front door!! there is no excuse for the driver not being able to deliver to me or for putting me thru such hassle, inconvenience, and terrible experience. none. 

i was livid. absolutely furious. i spoke with sunny and ana with customer service. they were very nice, especially ana,  but couldnât get my order to me. and the one thing that matteredâ the wine for the loveâ i could no longer order as it was past 11:30. 

this driver ruined my night. and customer service was of no help other than a credit to my account. 

fast forward to this evening. monday july 26thâ having cooled off, i decided to give gopuff another chance. surely that was fluke. i couldnât log into my account and was told my account was restricted. back to customer serviceâ¦. customer service said âthe warehouse has decided to not do business with youâ. 

are you kidding me? how is the customer and the victim of both horrible and predatory delivery service cut off from using her account? how does this empower customers to have a good experience and feel safe using a late night delivery service?

i would like an apology and my account back to use the credits and gopuff points that iâve accrued. i would also like both the warehouse and driver reprimanded.",7/27/2021 7:22,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,1,"today we ordered a $50.00 delivery. we wait an hour and nothing. after 30 minutes on the phone and declining to resend the order, or issue a refund the representative hung up.  after calling back, they claim it was delivered and id was presented, however they cannot confirm where they delivered it, or to whom.   

first experience and it could not have been any work.  we saw past the exorbitant fees: delivery, alcohol surcharge, and tip of course. buyer beware, when it seems too good to be true it probably is. disappointed and dissatisfied, we will see if the refund appears in several days.",7/25/2021 23:21,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"i have never had an issue with a delivery service understanding the risks of an interception or failed delivery. but recently, i have come to know that gopuff is a completely non understanding entity that values constant profit over customer satisfaction. until today, i have used gopuff for almost every delivery for various goods that i wanted on a whim. that changed when their customer service failed to understand the risks of their own employees not following simple instructions provided to them by the consumer. 

for reference, i live in a very large and busy city. delivering to my address requires a level of security, coming in the form of door codes / keyed entry / etc. whatever it takes to ensure that the delivery is not stolen prior to customer receipt. i provided my apartment door code very clearly in the delivery instructions, and the employee chose not to follow the instructions but instead deliver the items to the street in front of my door. when i went to receive the items (about 2-3 minutes after delivery notification), the items were not present. when i contacted customer service for a refund, they claimed that since it was a non-contact delivery (thanks a lot, covid), i would not be refunded for the delivery as i had elected to the risk of delivery theft. i had several lengthy conversations with gopuff support and quickly realized they value more the guaranteed profit from a single transaction than the constant support from a frequent user. this is a dying company and there are several substitutes that can provide the user with a more constantly assuring delivery process. gopuff, thanks for your service, but goodbye, and goodluck.",3/28/2021 8:52,gopuff,Apple

the other night i ordered from gopuff and the driver started cursing at me because his maps took him to the wrong address. iâve had the same address and never had issues with delivery until this guy. even then i felt bad was going to give him an extra tip till he started cursing at me and made me walk about a half mile to him in the dark to pick up my order.

Food Delivery,1,"i thought iâd finally give this app a shot after seeing an ad for free delivery on my first order. so, i downloaded the app, made a cart, applied my promo code, and placed my order. shortly after, i noticed that i had missed a phone call (from gopuff) and that my order had been cancelled. this doesnât make any sense to me. why canât the app just process my payment and deliver my order to me outside (or drop the stuff off on the porch) like all other mainstream food delivery services (uber eats, grubhub, caviar, doordash, etc). moreover, why does gopuff use two-factor order confirmation? isnât the placement of the order itself enough of a confirmation? you have my money; now deliver my order. if i donât show up outside to pick it up or donât answer the driverâs calls when they arrive, thatâs understandably on me. but a mandatory phone exchange before order pickup is just ridiculous. it almost feels like app-users are guilty until proven innocent. the only reasons i can think of for gopuff using two-factor confirmation are 1.) to maximize successful deliveries and 2.) make money off cancellation fees. but isnât gopuff actually losing orders (and future customers) by requiring a phone call? when it comes to buying snacks (especially at 2am), customers donât want to have to talk to other people. theyâre probably lying in bed high asf, expecting their order to be on its way after pressing the âplace orderâ button. so, by requiring a phone call to begin with and by cancelling orders when people donât answer the call from an unknown number, i feel like gopuff is actually driving away customers. theyâre not doing any sort of courtesy by adding layers of confirmation; theyâre just making things complicated and dysfunctional. i donât know if gopuff makes money off cancellation fees, but obviously that would be shady. their platform seems sketchy enough, though, for me to not put it past them.

putting all my frustrations aside, i decided to try again. i made a cart, entered my promo, and... my promo was rejected? did gopuff really count my last cancelled order as my first order? my promo code was really used up on a cancelled order? wow. this was when i uninstalled the app.

my girlfriend downloaded the app a few days ago and had no problems with her first order (because i was there to warn her not to miss the stupid requisite phone call). in her bag she was also given a âfree delivery on your next orderâ promo card (code: doubleup), which we both thought was nice. however, the code didnât even work when she tried applying it to her next order! no expiration date, rules, or restrictions were listed on the card; just the code and some cringey written nonsense. this was when she uninstalled the app too.

i feel like gopuff is pandering to poor college students with its broken promo codes, false promises, overcomplicated ordering system, sketchy platform, and cringey youth slang. gopuff, if you want people to use your app, make it simple, honest, and reliable.",5/29/2019 2:19,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,1,"i would give this app a higher rating if it was usable. however, i canât even log in. 

there are 2 methods to logging in, with phone number and facebook. when i use the phone number method, it sends a verification code. after i enter it, it asks for an email address. when i input the email address, it says âit is already takenâ

if i use facebook, the same issue pops up. itâll link with my facebook profile and asks for a phone number, when i input my phone number. it says âphone number already takenâ

as far as i can tell, there is no way for me to get around this. and i really donât feel like creating another facebook profile, phone number or email just to use the app. this seems like a pretty simple bug that should have been squashed during beta testing and development.",5/29/2019 2:06,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"at first i loved the concept and could forgive the consistent mistakes that were made but there were too many issues to overlook and at this point iâd advise anyone else to go to your nearest store and buy what you want the old fashioned way. delivery times are severely underestimated that 15-25 minutes really means 1.5 to 2.5 hours. at least half my orders show up with something missing, and a few times they did give me a discount code for my next order but that doesnât compensate for anything because they donât refund you for the item that was missing. i donât want to get a discount code to spend some more money only to have another item missing, that is not how a company should keep its customers. whatâs even worse is one particular time they canceled an order i made without refunding my money, i order again, not understanding why my order did not go through. later that day i get my delivery a few hours late as usual and everything is good. it was only a week later that i realized they still hadnât refunded me, call customer service who say they have initiated the refund and it should be there within 3-5 business days, a month goes by and nothing. at this point i have lost faith in their ability to do the right thing, i dispute the charge through my bank and the next thing i know, they have blacklisted me. itâs clear that they donât care about the customers if they are going to lie about refunds, there may be organizational reasons for whatever happened but gopuff you are a delivery company stop inconveniencing your customers",4/3/2019 2:12,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,1,"this app is a joke- 

1.) there are a ton of false claims all over their marketing and app. their page directly states that delivery is $1.95 always with no surge pricing ever when it's actually $3.95 or more when ordering through the app. they email and text you links offering promo codes and requests to leave feedback that don't actually lead to anywhere.

2.) don't expect any anonymity with this app or what you are ordering. the driver will know exactly what you order, where you live and your number and proceed to contact you however many times they want. 

3.) everything is pulled from a wear house so i imagine what doesn't get ordered gets stale over some time- i've ordered a box of cereal that was stale and chips that were expired and have read other reviews stating the same thing

4.) the minimum to order is $14 and delivery plus tax plus tip will add atleast another $5-6 so your orders will never be less than $20

5.) their ui is awful- you can't leave feedback or rate your orders and going back to the no anonymity comment- there is not input field to leave additional comments like gate codes etc. i had a driver tell me he gave up after having called me 3 times to get both the front and back access code to my apartment and i had to run out to grab my stuff to see that he was standing in front of my apartment? extremely unprofessional and creepy.",2/24/2019 5:54,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,"itâs obvious they are currently so focused on the paycheck that comes with expanding to different cities, they no longer care about the customers or their service. 

iâm a drexel student (where the apps founders started the company), and i remember last year & before deliveries were unbelievably quick (though orders were still incorrect ~40% of the time). 

iâm actually writing this as i wait for my order of one thing (juul device) to arrive. placed the order about an hour before i started writing this, just got a text saying itâs going to be late (âbetter late than uglyâ were the exact words :? ).  and this is a common occurrence now, despite seeing a pop up telling me i was in some âareaâ that allowed for âquick deliveryâ. 

tl;dr - the app has a great use case especially in philadelphia where it was founded. but, companies have become obsessed with investment money and expansion thinking theyâll be the next amazon / facebook. in reality, if this app stuck to the confines of its original city it would make for a phenomenal small business that would make founders rich for a long time. much like stars, they are expanding to their inevitable collapse. unfortunate.",9/24/2018 23:46,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,1,very unprofessional services. if you are going to run a delivery business you need a way of communicating with your workers so all customers get their orders in a timely manner. customer service rep need to be available 24/7 as far as emails with a quick response. also all items ordered should be kept exceptional such as keeping drinks in a cooler full of ice to keep them cool upon arrival. snacks that are easy to smash or crush need to be kept in a box or container then packaged upon arrival. customers need to get the service they are paying for because we could go to the original stores instead we choose to give you business for mess in return. gopuff fix it.,10/12/2018 14:31,gopuff,google

1rst time... wrong order delivered to my home, it ended up being a mushroom dish which i am listed as allergic to, they offered to bring me correct order and did 2 hours later
2nd time.... brought me half my order, half incorrect order, offered to bring the rest of my order and did so 
3rd time... brought me the completely wrong order and offered to bring me the correct one i declined and was given a refund since i didnât have 2 hours to wait
you think i would have never ordered from them again after this but have no other delivery option in my area and im clearly a sucker for pain
4th time... brought the wrong order, they said the driver would bring the correct one, 1.5 hours pass i call and am told driver is on the way, another 1.5 hours pass i call and told driver is on the way, 1.5 hours pass it is 11:30pm and i call and they say the driver isnt coming and give me a refund and i was out if luck since everything in my town closes by 10
5th time... 1/2 wrong order, they bring me the other half of my correct order
last time since i am now writing this review and deleting the app. my food was 45 minutes late, i call and they said driver is on the way. our order is marked as delivered, but we did not get our food. call and they said the driver was doing multiple deliveries and accidentally marked ours but he was going to be to our home in 10 minutes. 30 minutes later, noone arrives, we call and are told the driver delivered our order to the wrong house (so someone else got the wrong order) and we arenât getting it at all valentines day night...

i waited another 30 minutes (over 2 hours since i placed the order) and i tried delivery.com chat support. they gave me the same scripted response of how the driver was running late, was picking up the order, and was 15 minutes away. at this point i explained i was already told that 30 minutes ago and wanted a refund. the chat rep responded that they were contacting the driver. to be fair they sent that message right after i asked for a refund so we were likely typing at the same time.

i waited 5 minutes and the rep hadn't responded. i again asked for a refund. this time they replied and said they were refunding my order. nearly 2.5 hours after i placed my order and the restaurant had closed at that point.

a month ago someone from ca got a hold of my account and placed an order for pizza for about $78, i live in nyc so that wasnât me.
i called them because i was concerned that my info was compromised as well as my cc, all i could think was that their systems was either hacked or any of their employees have stolen my info, that person in ca placed the order using my account as if he/she was me. they refund my card and cancelled my account completely and said a supervisor will reach out to me. i still waiting for that.
i complaint with the bbb and they have argued that their systems were never hacked or compromised. they stupidly said that, somehow they are certain, i used the same login info from another website and perhaps that other website was compromised and that individual used the info to login on the delivery.com app as me. they actually said that from prior similar situations, compromised/ hacked companies have to made public the compromised costumerâs info and thatâs how perhaps that individual got a hold of my info, i have never heard of that plus it doesnât make sense at all. bbb still waiting for for a reply from them.

Food Delivery,2,"i never write reviews, buuuut here it is: iâm lazy and i donât like to go to the store, so i figured this app would deliver basically anything that a convenience store has... for like $6/mo! thatâs fantastic! 

the idea is great. i would just love for gopuff to develop a better system for syncing inventory with the app so it actually shows that items are out of stock in real time. iâve ordered approximately 5-6 times now, and about ten minutes after placing each order iâve received phone calls (sometimes multiple calls as they discover each item they donât have) informing me that multiple items are out of stock. therefore, i end up making a trip to the store anyways, and the purpose for me using the app is defeated.

also, iâm all for paying full price (sometimes prices are even higher than in walgreens, cvs, etc. also no sales) for the convenience of having the items delivered to me and at such a low cost! but... if iâm paying more to save myself a trip, at least save me the trip by not leading me to believe youâve got stuff in stock that you donât.

if sorted out, itâll be great and iâll applaud you. your customer service is great, which will get you far.",7/9/2020 3:57,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"this is a cool idea for a delivery service, and itâs great for the quarantine. but iâve noticed that on multiple different orders the food is usually off in some way. chips are stale, soda is flat, ice cream is freezer burned. iâm in the durham, nc, area and i donât know if others have had this experience too, but the products...stink. they smell bad. like burnt plastic. with dry goods itâs often affected the taste so much iâve had to throw some items out. it isnât the stink of expired goodsâall of the items smell  with the exact same plastic smell. to me itâs unappetizing. with the added cost of the food because itâs delivered only to get lower-than-gas-station-quality food, and sometimes throwing products away, it just isnât worth it. put on your sweats and make a run to the corner store, youâll get better service.",5/1/2020 18:43,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"i have mixed reviews. there have been times when my order came quickly and the drivers have been so nice, but iâve had times itâs been the opposite. 
one experience i had was i had ice cream in my order and as i tracked the driver they drove past my apartment twice to deliver to other people. this wouldnât bother me if they had properly stored my frozen goods but they didnât and they arrived melted. (they did give me a refund) 
i donât know if deliveries are dropped off in the order theyâre made but i would think they would also take into consideration the inefficiency of passing customers and compromising items. 
other times i put a notification in the notes of how to find my apartment and still most drivers either donât see it or donât pay attention. i have had orders dropped off at my neighbors door. 
i also often times find them out of stock of items, if they are a popular item one would assume they would prepare and properly stock up.

Food Delivery,2,"the gopuff app has been a revolution at our house and changes late night snack for the better.  or so we thought.

the first month or two was great, no issues at all.  but as their driver pool began to expand, it got way worse.  i often order after 10-11pm and on every single delivery i put the instructions âkids asleep please call on arrival, i will come out.â

5 out of the last 6 times this didnât happen and they rang the doorbell at 11 at night waking people up in the house; even with a message essentially begging them to call me.

whatâs worse, gopuff support started by offering 5$ off an order to âmake up for itâ (even though they canât come over and put my kids back to slee for me), they donât even offer this anymore.  they have a canned response now of âsorry we will try to do better.â 

i really like the app, but the drivers are killing it for me, and the lack of response from support on the issue is very disheartening.  i have spent a lot at gopuff, i hope they either fix this issue with their drivers and customer service or i will easily move to whatever inevitably comes next.",11/27/2019 22:43,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,i really like the idea of this app and i appreciate that they have gradually expanded their options in terms of what you can order however the wait times are just ridiculous. the app will usually start by predicting a delivery time of 30-45 min but then in actuality it ends up taking 2-3hrs. the app doesnât update in terms of where the delivery is at so i have no sense of how soon it will arrive and whenever i reach out to the help line all they can do is tell me to wait. with a wait this long it would be easier for me to just go to the store myself. please fix this gopuff!! i want to be able to continue supporting your app but this is just frustrating!,3/15/2021 22:40,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"i will try this app again when i move to a new location. first order, they were extremely late. i ordered 11pm and got my order 4am!!!! i did not expect to wait for an order past bedtime. the drivers here donât deliver straight to my apartment door the three times i ordered. the last order i had enough. they left my order on my apartment steps melted. ðð½customer service is really fast at solving your problems but the drivers i canât stand when i am tipping to have bad service. i can get better delivery service from ordering pizza. so disappointed â¹ï¸",5/3/2021 16:44,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,i was stuck home sick and needed my dogs food so i decided to use this app for the first time. i ordered adult dog food and got puppy food. i let them know and instead of sending out the right food they just refunded me which is great... but i needed food for my 9 year old dog. then 10 minutes after i got my order delivered another driver called and said they were at my door. i thought maybe they decided to send the right food out. but they actually brought another persons order and insisted that i ordered these things which i did not. the whole experience was just kinda weird. i wonât use them again.,2/2/2019 16:07,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"lots of functionality and ux bugs. even if i have previously signed in and ordered itâll ask me to enter my phone number upon sign in and then say an account already exists with this email. when i log in with my email it takes me back to the phone number on sign in and then the same process ensues.

even while using the app when you add something to bag it doesnât immediately update, so you have go to your bag multiple times to make sure the stuff has been added. 

there are lots of lags when switching between screens, and check out process is far from seamless. order tracking once ordered is also not clear.

finally, when the rider calls the number is automatically categorised as spam risk by apple which makes it confusing. (not sure how you can fix this one but just wanted to bring it to your attention)",1/31/2022 1:11,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,iâve used go puff a few time and typically my order gets there an hour or two later after the eta time. i deal with it because it was better than going to get those products on my own. i managed to save up go puff points about $12 worth and decided to use them. i waited 2hours after the eta time and they cancelled my order. not only did they cancel my order but they kept my points. they say a refund would be issued in 3-5 business days on their help page however itâs been 8 business days for me. use at your own risks.,4/21/2020 13:46,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,2,this was such a great app i had my first order and i loved it since then and it was amazing i can not ask for a better snacks or delivery app it was great and the people that delivered are very nice i was telling my friends all about it and it was everywhere but then gopuff decided to switch to credit card only and i am under the age to have one so i could no longer pay with cash which was horrible! deleted it since that happened if they bring it back trust me iâm definitely all in thanks for listening!,3/11/2020 19:10,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"as a service, gopuff is really convenient and i genuinely do enjoy my time with it. the problem is that the app tends to constantly go to the home menu with no input from me, and large amounts of food is added to my cart without my permission (i will admit having 69 reeseâs cups added to my cart was kinda funny). these problems can make the app sometimes impossible to use depending on how finicky it wants to be that day, and i dread the day that 100,000 cans of coke arrive at my door without my consent putting me in eternal debt.",2/3/2021 20:02,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,2,i just donât like how they make you spend a minimum of $12 when you only want one thing and then on top of that they still want you to tip the driver. i wouldnât mind tipping the driver if they let me just get the one item i want. basically i would have to spend more money on stuff that i really donât want just to reach the minimum order amount and then i would still have to tip. thatâs too much money.,2/27/2022 18:26,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,2,"update: this still holds true a year later and iâm actually reducing my rating by another star. i would say that their inventory is still regularly very low, they do not restock quickly at all taking weeeks maybe months for items to be back in stock.

when iâve asked customer support about this they admit that their managers donât keep the inventory on the app up to date even though they are supposed to do it nightly. which is why after placing an order their support staff need to call you to offer substitutions with almost every order. 

i genuinely wish there were a competitor i could go to. but gopuff has the monopoly for carrying groceries, household supplies, and booze all in one app and i hate the idea of placing multiple orders and paying multiple delivery fees and tips to purchase a few things. ugh smh.

-previous review-
pros: 
-quick delivery
-warehouse employees call and offer substitutes if your items are out of stock 
-friendly service

cons:
-2/3 of my orders have had to either be cancelled or significantly reduced because the items i wanted were out of stock or i had to substitute almost every item.  usually i end up canceling the order because the main items i need are out of stock, so i will have to go out to the store anyway. 

other:
the app is fairly easy to use, although itâs unclear when scrolling, that your automatically scrolling/moving into a new section, not viewing more items from the section you were in. so youâre first looking at ice cream and you select âview moreâ expecting more ice cream. but instead it loads frozen pizza...  not a big deal, just a little confusing.",10/29/2020 17:59,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,2,"they have everything a lazy college student could want. i wish there were female underwear options though. 

it's a little much to be charged a delivery fee on top of how expensive the items are. i always tip the driver so the added delivery fee is annoying. 

packaging is good, stuff arrives on time (2/2 so far within quoted time frame)

'puff points' seem silly. you should be able to redeem them for the items you normally buy.

edit: i've place another order since this review. all deliveries have been on time. i would love to see paper bags for packaging. 

i called about the headphones i purchased for $17-$19 that never really worked. 
i was told a manager wasn't available and someone would call me back. 
i'm lowering my review by two stars for a few reasons. customer service has been subpar on the headphones. headphones were overpriced to begin with. 

i wish i could see when the menu has been updated? perhaps an icon on the app ? i placed an order and they've often not had an item i would have otherwise was a niche interest without an expiration date.",2/12/2016 5:04,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"i've tried this service twice and both times they were slow (not enough drivers?) their stocking system doesn't work. i ordered and was told everything was out of stock. they always apologize and offer to put free stuff in there but never actually do it (idc if you don't, but if you offer it then you should go through with it). my 110 dollar order was delivered to the wrong house and had to wait until another driver was available. the app is very hip and easy to use, but thats where the compliments end. it's a growing business so i'll give them some slack, but they have some logistical issues to work out.

Food Delivery,2,i placed an order on the app . & the lady who came didnât have change so she said â oh iâll be right back i donât have any change â mind you it was around 10-14 dollars. i honestly thought she wasnât coming back until a different person came back with my money and i gave a bad rating . a gopuff worker called & asked why i gave the review . i told they the story & he was like â maybe you didnât know this but drivers donât have to provide change â i said  â so if i wanted to give a $5 tip & i only had a 10 dollar bill your drivers wouldnât give me my change ? â he was like basically like yeah thatâs your fault .,11/16/2018 19:25,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"i used to order so much from gopuff and they would always deliver. everything correct and on time, my family and i loved it! it wasnât until the last 5 orders or so in which they started messing up bad. always randomly cancelling my orders, missing 2-3 items, or just never showing up. now they donât deliver to my area anymore. i loved this app and the concept of it, honestly wish it worked as well as it did when i first started using it. i even had the membership and all, sadly had to cancel because i was just wasting money since they no longer delivered to my area. sad.",7/19/2018 20:47,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"iâve used several delivery services over the last year, and this one is honestly lacking. they donât have an inventory system, so several items i ordered needed to be replaced. my order took just about 70 minutes to arrive. my biggest issue, however was that none of the items had indicted sizes. i ordered several different chip and candy items, which i assumed were full sized based on the prices. i was disappointed to realize all but one item was just snack-size or single serving. $3-5 for a single serving of chips is just way too much. too expensive to be worth it.",2/10/2018 0:58,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"the app works just fine. it would be helpful if it was a bit more updated as far as giving accurate delivery time. waited an additional 45 minutes. all my items werenât with my order, i was paying with cash and the driver wasnât able to adjust my total. i also put special instructions for delivery upon arrival being that i have a dog that barks at every little noise after a certain hour and that wasnât followed either. i would probably only use this service in the future if it was dire need.",12/23/2017 7:40,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"i have ordered from gopuff about 4-5 times and not once has it been on time. thankfully it always gets to me eventually, but the wait makes you second-guess your choice to even order in the first place. often what is a spur of the moment purchase becomes a multi-hour waiting game in which you question your choices and realize you could have made multiple trips to the store in that time and saved money on delivery too. as some have said, great concept, but poor delivery.",4/28/2018 3:20,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"they are ok i like the prices and selections and everything but they are way too slow. even though iâve only ordered twice from them first impressions are always everything. my wait time for my order were no less than a hour i shouldnât have to wait that long, they have no way for us to contact support on the app if something is wrong. and the first time i ordered i ordered a cup of noodles with my order which they were out of and said they would refund but i never got my refund. please fix bugs!!!",1/2/2018 4:30,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"i shouldâve known after my first order showed up two hours past their âdelivery timeâ not to try it again, but i felt like giving them a second chance tonight. this time, i at least got a couple of texts saying they were running âa littleâ late. they said it would be here between 5:50-6, itâs 7:05 right now and their delivery person just showed up. very unreliable. they only get the second star because the products are accurate.",4/14/2018 1:03,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,i was looking forward to using this app. it looked very promising and also they have a distribution center in my area. i opened the app and i had see either sign up with a phone number or facebook. i donât have facebook so my number was what i used. when i typed it in after it said it sent a request to my number i didnât get it. i pressed the resend text button a couple times still got nothing. hopefully this will get fixed soon i would use this app a lot.,7/11/2018 7:09,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"iâve never had an issue until tonight. itâs bad enough that i was waiting 40 minutes to receive my order. now i have to deal with drivers that feel theyâre too good to drive around the corner when they parked in the wrong parking lot. 

iâve ordered from gopuff many times. this is the first time that iâve had an issue with a driver. i appreciate them offering to redeliver my order, but iâm not about to wait another 40 minutes because someone was having a bad day.",12/6/2017 5:35,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"unfortunately, i used to love using go puff as they advertised 30-40 minute arrival times. itâs now been lengthened to 1.5 to 2 hours, and they are literally always late. also, i live in a building that is fairly easy to get to my condo, and we have an area for free parking as well. iâve been called many times to have me come down to them, which i didnât mind at first, but then i realized that they are the only delivery company that gives me grief when i ask them to come to my door...",8/27/2018 22:04,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,when i first saw this app i was amazed and immediately i got it. they told me to put down an address so i did. they said that they couldnât deliver to my street address. then i put in my cousins house because i always sleepover there and we do the normal teenager things. like staying up late playing video games and eating food! anyways i put in his address and it also said we can not deliver it there. i was so mad because this could have been such a good app. please expand very soon.,10/5/2018 11:18,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"i've used this app twice. the first time the delivery took almost two hours. the second time, no delivery at all. i think it is strange that there is never a delivery confirmation sent. maybe an up to the minute delivery map would be cool so delivery time can be gauged more easily. i might try this one more time, but for simple snacks it's come at a steep price. it's cool that they offer some other supplies, but for higher prices items i don't know if i could trust this app.",3/2/2015 15:21,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,unfortunately the app canât generate an accurate eta for order regardless of the stage. iâll receive a text from gopuff that says my order is delayed but the app has said â10 minutes awayâ for the past hour. thereâs also no option to cancel a delayed order so now i donât know when it will be here but canât audible and go to the store. would be nice if they fixed this part since the service is strong otherwise.,11/11/2018 23:55,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"idk who runs the show in my area, but the general trend is that despite promising you an order time of 15-20, that is never the case. i use that app consistently and that has probably happened one time? it is not uncommon for me to wait an hour for my things. one time i never even got my stuff and the customer service rep gave me a coupon on my account, but of course when i went to use it, it didnât work. disappointed but not surprised.",12/2/2018 5:33,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"so i live in ohio and i get an advertisement for an app that i actually think  that the concept is perfect. i download said app to receive a message that i am out of location and no one delivers to me. so usually advertising is pretty good at being personalized but at this point at least make sure that the people that are receiving this are in an area that they could actually use the services.
sincerely 
disappointed and munchieless",8/20/2018 3:36,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"obviously this app is exactly what stoners need but they have no accountability. if an order is delivered an hour after the estimated arrival time, and you bring it to their attention, theyâre just like âoh, sorryâ and if part of your order isnât delivered and you bring it to their attention, theyâre like âoh, we can re deliver itâ but i donât want it several hours later when you finally got to my email. so yeah, customer service for the app blows.",2/25/2018 16:40,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"this app has the most annoying advertisements in the world!!! even after i decided to download the app because of the 15 dollar special they where having for new costumers, the app doesnât even deliver to my location! itâs not like iâm in the middle of no where. and the fact that they flood my phone with advertisements is ridiculous. at least have a geo filter on who can actually use your app.",1/14/2019 22:17,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"i havenât used this app too much but the only experiences iâve had have been mediocre at best. my first order: the weâre out of both my items (gatorade and advil) and the refund took 2 days. my second order: all of it came but it took 2 hours. my 3rd order: i placed my order and then received a call informing me that they were out of an item that i did not even order, i tried to tell the man that i hadnât even ordered that and he told me the couldnât do substitutions over the phone? i thought okay well just send the rest of my order. i get the rest of it and both of the other two items i ordered were the wrong ones. i still havenât been refunded for the item i never got.",5/4/2018 5:51,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"honestly? loved it when it first came out. wouldâve loved more options and variety but it was a solid app, especially since it helped with the whole âdepression doesnât let me out of the houseâ thing. 

but, what the hell happened? 

the delivery person was rude because he couldnât find a parking spot. he didnât tell me this when he asked me what heâs supposed to do. i told him to come upstairs like i normally do and he got mad? 

also, why arenât we told who our delivery person is and what their mode of transportation is? itâs not fun having to stand outside in the dark not knowing if they made it yet or not because they got lost. 

wot 

yâall have potential, okay. stop this foolishness.

Food Delivery,2,my last few orders have gotten delivered an hour+ outside of the delivery window. one of them was an hour and forty five minutes past the delivery window. i contacted their customer support who is supposedly available 24/7. that was over a week ago and i am yet to hear anything back. there are other apps i'd use over this one for this kind of service going forward.,1/12/2017 13:42,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"maybe the delivery is done in less than 30 minutes... after they've picked your items. my estimated delivery time for my very first order was 30-50 minutes. also, when i received my items, it smelled of cigarettes and weed. don't get me wrong, i am 420 friendly, but i don't appreciate my delivery driver getting high in the car when i've paid a fee to have something brought to me.",5/20/2017 6:19,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,they have no tracking service so youâre sol if they have an issue with your order because when you call the number provided they only answer after about three or four calls. the only reason they got two stars is because i actually got what i paid for even though their customer service is bs.,10/1/2017 1:56,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,your inventory is never correct according to whatâs on your app. each time i order i receive a call that you are out of stock if a certain item. you also need to refund your customers the same day before that payment settles at the bank the next day. it can be done. i wonât be ordering until these items are fixed. update: was never refunded. delete,2/20/2018 12:09,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,i love the variety and convenience that gopuff offers - they carry most of my favorite snacks and bring them to my door at 3am. but the delivery times have become painfully long. â30 minutes or lessâ is a lie. most of orders take at least 90 minutes to make it to my door. iâm currently waiting on an order i placed almost 2 hours ago.,12/10/2017 3:27,gopuff,Apple
Food Delivery,2,"sometimes gopuff is great, but most of the time the order is much later than the predicted time (with no tracking available) and the orders are consistently wrong. iâve received the wrong sized items numerous times, sometimes the wrong items all together. tl;dr donât order gopuff unless you have all night to spend waiting or dealing with their call center.",8/11/2018 1:18,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,2,"let me tell you what really pisses me off about the app. ok? so thereâs a $10.95 min order requirement, cool. itâs a weird number if you ask me, like why not just make it $10 ð¥´ anyways, i usually order the same thing: ben & jerryâs ice cream. the moment you activate one of your discount codes from your points, youâre stuck! thereâs no way to remove the discount code. now i receive a notification that iâm $0.16 away from the order minimum quality. this wouldnât be a problem if i could remove the discount code but now i have to add more to execute my order? gopuff products are already priced at what seems like at least 30% above the retail price... and you want me to add more? and iâm only .16 cent away? lol no way.  i also wanna reiterate that $10.95 is a weird number. make it $10.",2/12/2021 15:17,gopuff,Apple

Food Delivery,2,the app keeps changing the tip amount between bag and checkout. eg: i put $7 and it lowers it to $2. or it removes the tip altogether. obviously can't place an order now. reported this bug a half dozen times over the last year. it keeps coming back to screw over delivery people.,1/25/2020 11:03,DeliveryCom,google

Food Delivery,2,overall ok too many issues have cause me to stop using this app and service. app crashes are very common causing you to re-place your order items to order. promo code registration can be hit or miss. you consistently need to close down the app and redo. as for the service. several places have better promos ordering direct. orders have been showing up incomplete. and pickups are pretty slow and unwelcome vs the other services. i would not recommend this service.,2/11/2019 12:17,DeliveryCom,google

Food Delivery,2,my main complaint is that it will not remember your preferences and will swap to delivery instead of pickup mid order and if you don't notice it you end up going to the store while your food goes somewhere else.,12/9/2015 16:11,DeliveryCom,google
