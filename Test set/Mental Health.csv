mental health,1,"had hoped this app would help, but it only made me more stressed and upset. keeping score and subtracting when you miss something? scrambling to keep up and not miss things? turning happiness into a competition? not a positive thing! now i feel like i have to measure up and do better and succeed more when that kind of stress is part of the problem to begin with. it was also really distracting with pop-ups about winning certain perks, not to mention confusing as to what they are and do. honestly, not here to try and earn points. i found the overall layout pretty confusing as well. the emails that are meant to encourage you to do more activities in the app are incredibly annoying. also didnã¢âât like what i read in the legal and privacy policies, and feeling forced to share my real data. iã¢ââd have paid money for an app that was actually relaxing and uplifting while maintaining a feeling of anonymity and privacy. this is not that.",9/29/2019 3:33,happify,apple
mental health,1,"it starts by showing you a very busy screen with all these different tracks you can take and some are paid which is immediately stressful and feels like theyã¢ââre going to try to push their paid product. then it goes through all these animations that go too fast to read properly selling the app saying x% of people are happier after doing our activities. i felt like i already got the app why is it trying to convince me of getting it. iã¢ââm trying to use it. then i tried one game with balloons were you have to focus on positive words on the balloons but the ui is janky and it just made me more stressed. as you can see, not feeling positive at all after using ã¢ââhappifyã¢ââ.",10/16/2018 2:37,happify,apple
mental health,1,"this app has you do one small insignificant part of a larger task and then tells you that you can't do anything else unless you pay for a full premium version...isn't the point of getting someone to pay for premium that you actually provide a good service and convince them it's worth the money?
 i have not benefitted in the least and it's making me annoyed to start a task, but halfway through it says i can't finish the task unless i pay. based on what i've seen thus far i would never pay for it. it's not even high quality or worthwhile. there are better freemium apps that actually provide value for free and are worth the paid upgrade",3/19/2018 2:01,happify,apple

mental health,1,"bottom line, stay with the free version. the premium isn't worth it and not only that but happify chased me to update my credit card so they could charge me even though i'd paid upfront for a two year membership. greedy, greedy - not at all happy. long version: i was real impressed with happify when i first downloaded it. there's a lot you can do from your phone  and it's a great thing for times when you're stuck waiting and want to do something productive with your time. i was so impressed, i went ahead and sprang for the two year premium membership which provides extra activities and allows for more content, at a cost of just over $75. that was in feb. this month in may 2015 happify started sending me one email after another stating they needed my credit card updated so they could auto-charge me for my membership. seemed odd to me because i remembered signing up for a while, so i went on their website and it took a while, but i finally found where sure enough i was signed up until feb 2017. since i don't really use the premium services, i sent an email through their contact us option, thanked them for reminding me that i don't really need the premium services by bugging me with these credit card reminders, and asked them to cancel my membership. i got an email back saying i could only cancel in the first 30 days and get a refund, but that they would turn off the auto-renew option. so buyer, beware.",5/27/2015 19:38,happify,apple
mental health,1,"i had wanted to sign up for a yearly plan, i was under the impression it would be a minimum obligation of the 12 months and if canceled prior to the 12 months there would be a penalty. i would be okay with a minimum obligation but would like to comment on this.  it's hard to say your app is there to help people when it isn't cost enough for the vast majority of people.  when the vast majority of the united states population is middle class or lower, your ""helpful app"" is not the easiest item or service to click ok for a $60 purchase!  not to mention if $60 is a lot of money(for a year) obviously $12 & change a month is out of the question when they can't throw out $60 for a year.  i have to say i feel the app is more of a business venture than a truly helpful means for people.  which is sad because it's more than likely isn't your only ""job"" or means of income. i understand business and that you have to have money coming in to fuel the business or it will cease to exist, but i feel this is preying on the weak and vulnerable.  it should be an affordable subscription, if truly meant to help people.  even subscriptions such as pandora are cheaper and paid monthly.  it seems your app is trying in a desperate attempt to grab as much money as quick as possible before the people realize this & your app fads away.",6/28/2016 4:37,happify,apple
mental health,1,"happify claims, ""money can buy happiness."" i should have known better after reading that! the app only has certain features available for nonmembers, making it almost impossible not to buy a subscription in order to use its full capacity. when deciding a subscription, it gives you several price options. i picked the $4.99 a month option but when i checked my account (to my dismay) i was charged over $55 to my account!! i contacted happify support team right away and let them know that i did not intend on paying a whole year subscription up front and that i needed a refund because i had bills to pay. they messaged me back quickly and on a weekend (which they made sure to mention) and stated that since the subscription was purchased through apple they could not give me a refund! they told me to contact apple for my money back. i'm completely bedside myself, $60 down the drain for an app i only wanted to check out! i'm frustrated because apple support has no clue what i'm talking about either. beware, if you're reading this review. i downloaded this app to find happiness and be serenity, i felt broke and frustrated!",8/29/2015 21:31,happify,apple

mental health,2,"the concept of this is promising and pleasant; and some of the activities are calming and increase happiness in moments of stress. however, it is designed around several key concepts that actually *increase* stress, eliminating any initial gains in happiness.

1. the ""achievement"" model (of earning medals and levels of activities) creates a sense of imperative and outstanding tasks, or else not performing up to standard, that are the sources of so much stress and unhappiness already.

2. the app disallows revisiting an activity that had significant benefit by inducing calm and enjoyment. this 'feature' increases the stress of the moment upon realization that ""something that helped"" is not and will not ever again be available. this is like being teased with relief, that is then permanently removed.

3. the issues in 1 and 2, above, lead to a sense of being 'forced' into activities and paths, the experience of which negatively impacts happiness.

4. the mixing of premium features *within* the 'list of happiness tasks' (the way it is currently done) can trigger a negative sense of 'gotta have it' while in the very midst of moving through happiness activities. instead of attracting and gently drawing one into the desire to upgrade to the premium experience--say, in response to it being effective and worthwhile--the  approach is based on an ""i'm going to miss something important, that i really need, if i don't upgrade."" this is the a psychologically manipulative marketing approach that triggers a deprivation response which negatively impacts happiness.

the only reason it achieves 2 stars rather than 1, here, is that the concept and actual activities have such promise.  unless the high-pressure tactics used are rethought and revised, however, avoid placing yourself into the stress-creating traps that this tool currently employs.",4/30/2015 23:59,happify,apple

mental health,2,"dropped what was a 5 star review down to 1, then up to 2, since they seem like they are listening to feedback.       the newest update has almost had me uninstall this app. the graph display is not comprehensive, they have it split into each different category so you have to look at multiple graphs and can't see the bigger picture easily. for the sleep tracker that they have it on a sliding scale without a plus or minus option so it's incredibly difficult to log the actual amount of sleep unless you have a steady hand.      in order to use all the app features you have to pay a monthly subscription?! a one-time fee is completely reasonable, but to require a monthly subscription for an app that has always been free is bull.        i know i cannot speak for other people who use this app, but i'm definitely not made of money, because of my behavioral difficulties. which i use this app to help me manage. talk about counter productive! horribly disappointed in the developers and owners.     all white/bright backgrounds are jarring, especially when i already have a migraine. background color options would be nice.   (review before)it was ok before but is even better now. the only thing i'd add would be an optional checkmark daily to indicate if there were drastic mood variations within the same day. like, high manic episodes 3 times , 2 major mood drops, in 24 hours. as it is now you can show that you were both elevated and depressed within the same day, but not if it was both multiple times/how many times within said day.",2/7/2017 12:06,emoods,google

mental health,2,"the design is prettier though somewhat less user-friendly but the major irritant is how medications are handled. instead of my current meds and dosage to choose from, i have all meds i've ever taken and all dosages - my menu has over 3 dozen items and multiple duplicates & they're not in alphabetical order!  i appreciate your efforts but this is a dog's breakfast. the old way is much simpler; previous day is assumed to be the new default dosage for  medication until it's adjusted.  rinse & repeat.  return this feature and your valuable   app goes back to its rightful 5 stars",2/4/2017 15:30,emoods,google
