look. iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve wasted so much money and time ordering with postmates. thatÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs my own fault. but man....their customer service is awful. theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre rude and practically nonexistent. thereÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs been a few times where iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve had missing items or something is not cooked(that one happens a lot??) and they never refund me. theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll only credit you partially unless you go back and forth with them. the last order i made was not completed right. there was a cookie missing. i thought itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂd be an easy refund/credit. so i submitted a ticket and they straight up told me in the exact words ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂwe looked into the issue and it actually appears there wasnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt an issueÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ. so i went back and forth with their customer service and eventually once i requested a call from a supervisor(they kept sending the same generic template email to me) they credited $1 back to my account. you also apparently canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt just delete your account like iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve been trying to do. i requested a ticket for my account to be deleted and they said theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂd call me. just stay clear. please just make the drive or use a different service. this is a legal scam lol.",4/2/2019 14:49,postmates,apple,bank statement,,,,1

1,"i gave doordash a chance a few years ago and was severely disappointed. for some reason, six orders in a row were canceled without telling me and most recently (about 2 years since iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve last used the app), my credit card info was stolen and used to by $112 worth of bbq in a different state. 

i immediately called my bank to cancel the card, cancel the charge, etc and then called doordash to let them know my account was compromised. i spoke to a very nice woman who pulled up my info, refunded the $112, and promptly deleted my account. 

the next day, that ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂrefundedÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ money was gone from my account and i had 3 emails saying that i needed to provide bank statements showing that i was indeed scammed.

1,"i usually  order from work, so i placed an order thinking my location was on. within 2 minutes of hitting place order i canceled. in tried to change location and make exact same order... but realized location was still wrong. son within 4 minutes i canceled 2 orders. 

i never got a order confirmation or restaurant recovering, accepting, preparing... nothing. so i assumed it was all set. finally i made the correct order and location.

i never checked my credit card statement since my 2 orders said canceled. well a month later i get my bank statement and both orders which were exactly the same and placed and ordered within 4 minutes was on there. 

if it had n one of the orders i would have been less mad... or if i had known i was going charged i work have picked up the order!!!

after talking to multiple people from uber customer services they said they can only refund within 7 days..... and i should have f my statement. but i had trust since they said canceled. 

for such a large company to not refund my $.... and their system clearly messed up the cancel really puts a bad taste in my mouth.

1,"charged twice for orders, the resolution is completely out of the hands of 
restaurant owners due to transactions are handled through doordash. 
requested refund, that has been a month ago. my bank will be challenging 
their orders to get my money back. the restaurant i reached out to was 
incredibly helpful but could not resolve the issue, they could not 
understand why the app would withdraw the order twice. after reading other 
reviews, it appears to be happening with other participants. i wanted this 
app to work, but their customer service fails miserably - people cannot 
support apps that operate appropriately only half of the time. go back to 
the drawing board, figure it out. start with the customers first. if you 
want to reward your patrons with a discount for referrals, actually 
implement it into the app.. i never received any sort of discount for 
bringing people on board. now i am having to apologize for the lack of 
service. repair your issues and take care of your supporters, i can revisit 
the application - but for now, i will be supporting other similar apps. for 
everyone else, check your bank statements and make sure you're not paying

1,"customer service has no intention of helping you as seen in my case where i was charged literally double for an order i get all the time. i have been a customer of postmates for about six months and consumer of deli every services for over a year and have never encountered this level of blatant thievery.

in my first complaint, i told them about very incorrect charges. my order has always been $19.92(including a 20% tip) and was charged for exactly double of that, $39.84. thatÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs strange iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm of itself. i got a price breakdown from the customer associate and they assured me that the extra cost may have been from pre authorization charges. this is not true as i received an email receipt dictating that  i was charged $39.84. this is reflected in my chase bank statement.

i complained a second timed, informing them of this and was informed that they would be ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂhappy to breakdown my charges.ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ i quickly realized that they were trying to give me the run around. i readied my third complaint with pictures of my previous orders where i was only charged $19.92, the outstanding charge of $38.94 and how it did not add up, a price breakdown by a previous associate that clearly added up to $16.60 (excluding tip), and finally my receipt that charged me $38.94. before submitting my email, i added an addendum that warned if they did not take my email seriously i would have to consider them to be scammers.

 i was met with the identical response that i got from my second complaint.

 if you have an issue, there is  absolutely no reason to contact customer service. having contacted them 3 different times, i can assure you that they have a system that analyzes your complaint and regurgitates something that fits the script.

in addition, there is no other way to contact postmates besides through email support. this is clearly set up so that postmates can give as little effort as possible.

i only hope that they can see this review and give me another avenue of response as i still have a membership with them.",6/16/2020 3:10,postmates,apple,bank statement,,,,0

this was the first time i used this app and iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm not gonna use it again. i donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt really know who to blame. the app or delivery person. i made an order of three items but i received far more then what i ordered. i ordered two soups, one large and one medium. when we received the soups there were five styrofoam cups. two large and three medium. i was surprised to see so many cups. turns out the guy ordered five soups! two large and three medium. instead of paying what shouldÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve been $30 i ended up paying $86. i couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt believe it. now if youÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve used the app youÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll see that they put your order in a list type for example 1.sandwitch 2.soup 3. soup. so what the guy did was that he ordered one sandwich two large soups and three medium soups. i canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt understand how he wouldÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve seen those numbers as amounts of each item. i also donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt like the fact that it says you wonÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt get an accurate price and total until the person picks up your food. shouldÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve known better and seen that as a bad sign. one more thing i have a charge of $9 and change on my bank statement. when i added that to the $77 i was charged for the order the amount comes more then  what is shown on my email receipt. i donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt know what the heck is going on but i definitely wonÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt be using this app again.",5/6/2019 6:33,postmates,apple,bank statement,,,,0

1,"i am literally appalled at the quality of service i've received. 

i made 3 orders over a week period. i was charged for each of those orders, and the payments were processed.

a week later, i am charged again for those three orders, all at once. they double charged me for three orders! this was over $60.

this overdrew my account, and i was subsequently charged four ""returned item"" fees, $35.00 each, a total of $140.00. including the overcharges, $204.33. over $200. 

so naturally i contact postmates as soon as i notice, assuming i will be refunded and it's all just a big mistake. they don't have a phone line, by the way. 

i sent a very long email full of screenshots of my bank statements and postmates orders, detailing everything that happened. 

i get a literal paragraph long response essentially saying, ""those double charges were pre-authorization fees."" 

no explanation, no apology, no trying to work with me. 

first of all, how is it a pre-auth if it comes after my account has already been charged? how is a pre-auth charging me over $50 for one order? 

i replied, and got no response. 

my bank (boa) took care of it, refunding everything, and i'm so grateful for their service. 

no help from postmates. 

it's not the mistake that pisses me off. accidents happen (although, seeing all these reviews makes it seem like it's a pretty common occurrence). 

it's the service i received. if i'm spending $25 on $13 worth of food with your company, the least you can do is pretend to care about your customers.

please beware. what they are doing is borderline criminal and fraudulent.",12/23/2015 17:24,postmates,apple,bank statement,,,,0

2,"i literally never write reviews. but about $50 of unjustified charges that i had to contest through my bank later...

the drivers are great, and iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve had minimal issues receiving my orders. 

i have never subscribed to uber eats pass, and this is about the 5th time that iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve ordered delivery and a random $9.99 charge appears on my bank statement in addition to the delivery/food charge. it does not say that i have the subscription on my account, so clearly the charge was not for the uber eats pass.

had i not been avid about checking my bank account, these charges would have gone totally unnoticed. i suspect they are leeching money from a lot of people in this manner. 

i tried to get to the bottom of the mysterious charge with their support service, and they were completely useless. support simply told me to ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂturn off auto renewalÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ and that they ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂdidnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt give refunds for subscription servicesÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ. except, i donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt have the service and the charge was completely unjustified on their end. good thing the bank will fight it.

two weeks later i noticed the charge in my bank statement. i contacted them again and they refused to correct the matter because 7 days had passed. 

the restaurant failed to prepare my food within the time given at the time of purchase.

the delivery person failed to ensure that they had received my complete order for the restaurant.

1,"i used to love this app and would use it regularly to get food from my favorite restaurants delivered to my house. unfortunately i will never use it again as this company has repeatedly demonstrated an utter lack of customer service, and a penchant for committing unethical business practices. beware: if your order is incorrect or missing items, postmates will not fix the issue, and they will keep all of the money you paid, even if you back up your claim with bank statements, receipts, and food tickets pertaining to the order and proving your case. in reply to an email i sent requesting a credit for a missing item, they blatantly lied and stated i had been credited, when all of the records that i meticulously keep indicated otherwise, that i was charged 100% of the original amount. i showed them the initial bank charge, the same bank charge once it posted, and a ticket showing the date and missing item, and still they refused to help. in their email they told me to stop bothering them about the same issue and to stop using their service if i didn't like it. phenomenally unprofessional!!! this has happened on multiple occasions where an order is incorrect and it takes up to two weeks of emailing back and forth before i receive any form of compensation or apology, all the while the ""customer service"" representatives will send you disgustingly patronizing, condescending emails telling you why you're wrong and they're right (even though in the end, with multiple emails and lots of evidence demonstrating their mistake, they finally admit fault). this time, they refused to acknowledge fault and in so many words, told me to get lost. they would rather pocket your money illegally than retain a loyal paying customer. i will be switching to a competitor for food deliveries (probably uber eats - they're actually an organized company and they've never done me wrong) and will continue to inform everyone i know of this shady company who thrives only because of stealing money from their customers.",7/19/2017 19:05,postmates,apple,bank statement,,,,0

on dec 12th i placed an order in ubereats.
ubereats charged me again on dec 13th.

i reached out to uber support, they told me itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs only authorization hold and would go away.

and the end of 2020 itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs on my bank statement and didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt go away. i asked my bank to dispute the second charge.

and thatÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs not the end.

on jan 22, 2021 when i tried to book a ride in uber(yes! in uber!), it forced me to pay $20.19 before i could book any ride. i was in a hurry for a doctorÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs appointment so i did.

afterwards, i contacted uber support for this issue again. all they told me itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs the nonsense again, ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂwe care about customer experienceÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ and told me to ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂcheck help pageÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ.

this time i canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt dispute the charge.

i canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt express my disappointment and anger. i will  seek other ways to get back the $20.19 and i will say goodbye to uber and ubereats. i just want to say share my experience here; i cannot tell you how many emails i sent to uber support email team and to their twitter accounts. they have no solution and eventually no response.

if you donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt care about this, i will say go ahead and feel free to continue using uber products. however, if you donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt want to go through what i went through, i would recommend to learn from my lessons.

2,"iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve only used this app twice, but giving 2 stars because they apparently charge you for a 40% tip to your delivery driver from a 2 week old order.. i got on the app last night to search for a restaurant in my area. before i could begin my search, the app asked me to rate my experience from an order i had placed over 2 weeks prior. i happily gave the restaurant good ratings, and gave my delivery driver good ratings as well. then to my surprise, a notification pops up that a tip has been added to this 2 week old order. how this happened, i have no clue. i then go onto my bank statement to find that i was charged for a 40% tip on this order.. again, how this happened, i have no clue. i never typed in any tip amount, let alone authorize the app to charge a tip to my account. i reached out to customer service about this issue and was responded to with a message that said they are only able to edit tip amounts up to an hour or 2 after delivery, and that i should please be careful to check that my order is correct before submitting it next time. if this is their policy, then how on earth was i charged a tip two whole weeks after the fact?? not only does their tip policy contradict itself, but how i was charged a tip in the first place still perplexes me. 

i hope my delivery driver enjoys her tip. her service was satisfactory.

i also had an order canceled after already waiting for it for a long time - and then was informed that even though the restaurant canceled my order, since they had already started making my food, i would be charged for it. when i tried to respond to the message, i got an auto reply stating i replied to an address that canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt receive messages.

1,"recently i decided to use the month of free trial with dash pass. it gives you free delivery on selected restaurants if your order is over $15. i tried it out a few times, and then decided i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt like it. obviously, as a free trial, i cancelled it long before the day i would be charged!  thereÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs no harm in trying something but not liking it, right? well, june 15th comes along (the day i would be charged $9.99 for dash pass), and i see a dash pass charge in my bank statements! i made sure i cancelled it yet i was still charged! i notified door dash of this, and they said they would refund me and that it would take 5-7 business days. i even called and emailed so many people to be assured i would get my refund. i waited 7 business days, no refund. so, i email support again, and they ask for my bank statements and etc, as proof that i did not get a refund. they all keep assuring me the refund has been processed, until i get a new email from someone else saying that all the previous emails contained wrong information and that i am unable to receive a refund now. what?! i waited 7 days for this company to repeatedly lie to me, and then tell me i canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt get a refund because of their own mistake. i cancelled the dash pass and was supposed to be assured that i wouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt be charged, but obviously this company canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt keep up. donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt use this sketchy app or give any money to this twisted and distrustful company that has lied and screwed many people over, including me.",6/22/2019 14:45,doordash,apple,bank statement,,,,0

1,"so i originally got this app after having issues with grubhub. at first things were fine. but then i noticed on my bank statements i was being over charged. when you go to check out it tells you the subtotal, delivery fee (which are outrageous), taxes, and if you have a promo. i recently used a promo for $5 off my order. so i use it. it tells me my total is $23 with everything all together. you tip after the food arrives so i already calculated how much it will be after the tip.  so i tip the delivery driver and my total should have been a little less than $30. instead i was charged a little over $35. almost $10 over charged. i tried to see how i can get ahold of someone to help me and i can't find a way to do that. then i look at the receipt and it charged me an additional $6 fee that they do not tell you about or show you. it was a service fee in addition to the tip and in addition to the delivery fee. if they told you when you were checking out that there was an additional service fee that would be one thing. but not to tell you and to over charge you is another. and i cannot figure out how to talk to an agent or someone. this isn't honest and this isn't ok. you don't take more money from people when they have no idea. if this restaurant is a premium restaurant and you charge extra to have people pick up from there then you need to advertise it as such before people order. do yourself a favor and don't think about downloading this app. don't subscribe to this joke.",8/15/2019 3:09,postmates,apple,bank statement,,,,0

2,"so.
i originally stopped using ubereats because for awhile they wouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt come to my house door, and when iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂd go and grab my food none of the drivers ever had the decency to remove themselves from the vehicle to hand me the food. it just seemed lazy. i know a little petty. but still annoying. 
anywho. looks like the options changed and so i started using uber eats again. i probably ordered about 3-4 times. then this last time was hell. so thereÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs a pending charge then an actual charge. typically the pending charge is taken back same day. not this time. so itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs like i was double charged, because this holding charge never went away. so the next day i message them and i send them my bank statement. they said i should see it back in my bank in 1-3 business days (itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs a monday). so i wait. day 3 comes and i still donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt see it. i message them once again. they now tell me 3-5 days or call the bank to release the hold. so now iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm a little frustrated because they told me originally 1-3. so i call my bank and they see no hold other than the one being removed from my account. so my trust for uber is a little low at this point. it takes awhile for them to respond to you in the messages (anywhere from 20min to an hour). i had already waited 30 min before i got a response back from the response i gave them so i called them. this lady told me she had no idea what i was talking about. that there was nothing on their end saying anything about $63. told me to send a bank statement (already happened) and it could take 48hours for a response(now iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm trying not to boil). so i gave up. i called the bank to dispute the charge. honestly if i were more patient it wouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt be a problem. but after three days and being told several different things i got very annoyed and my patience had been thinned. needless to say i will not be using ubereats again and i will continue using other apps whoÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll just void pending charges same day with out complications.",7/3/2019 19:22,ubereats,apple,bank statement,,,,0
1,"so... postmates is insane.... i was ordering maybe 3x a week with them and started getting a bit suspicious when i saw my bank statements. the total of some of my orders changed dramatically from a $28 charge to $49 charge... yes, they charge you a different price than what you agree to pay and they take it from the ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂpending chargesÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ. 

once i caught that, i looked back at my past orders and saw they were charging me an extra few dollars ranging from $2 to $24 more!... i added up the total of the items i ordered and saw that their ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂsubtotal + taxÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ would only be correct if they were charging me 80% on tax sometimes... what kind of insanity. how are they getting away with this? they owe me a total of $180 in extra charges right now! 

so guys if you want to use an app that lies about pricing and charges you more than you agree on then they are perfect for you... cause i found out if the store you are ordering from is not a partner of theirs, then they donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt have to be accurate with their menus! i smell class action lawsuit ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ°ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ",1/14/2020 4:24,postmates,apple,bank statement,,,,0

1,"uber eats has fallen on its face over the last 6 months. i made a 50$ order and canceled it less than 5 minutes later. people change their minds! low and behold uber charged me a 35$ cancellation fee. that right there is theft in my opinion. the restaurant didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt have time to even start on my order. never mind the order being in someoneÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs car on its way to me. that i could understand. but here is where is get even worse.  i have canceled orders like this before. i have not had any issue. this time i was not notified that there would be a 35$ fee on a 50$ order. anyone in their right mind would have just kept the order and had it delivered. not to mention after canceling i made a difference order with another restaurant. if i new about the fee uber would not have gotten my business. i  talk to customer support and they said i had 48 hours to reach out. lol you guys are a joke! how am i supposed to reach out with an issue on a refund when in most cases refunds take more than 2 days to be processed. i looked at my bank statement and for the entire weekend it said -50$ awaiting final amount from merchant. then comes monday my account says -35$. customer (whatever) because they arenÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt a service or help. tells me it was outside of the 48 hour window. this coming from a hospitality/resort worker for almost a decade. uber  has no business being in the food and restaurant industry. they have no clue how restaurants operate. they also donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt care about their own drivers, or the restaurants now not even the customer. they sit behind their safe computers and phones. while drivers are doing all the work/take all the risk, and the customer puts their order in the hands of a third party stranger. i will never order uber eats again and itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs a shame i have no problem supporting the driver. iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm also a good tipper as well always have been and always will. so if or when i ever choose to get delivery. iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll only choose places that hire their own drivers. hope that 35$ goes a long way for you. seems that you cared more about that than a customers satisfaction and continued business. good luck with a business model like that. i wonder how many customers get robbed by uber eats everyday. iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂd give negative 5 starts if i could",3/11/2021 17:24,ubereats,apple,bank statement,,,,0

i think it would be a good idea for the app to include this feature so people can request for example extra napkins, hot sauce, utensils, etc. 

now iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm left eating my chipotle with no napkins no tortilla, no tabasco hot sauce. 

also donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt understand the purpose of a temporary authorization hold on a card thatÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs been used on the app and verified.

ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂkayla l.ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ was actually a black male. so not only are they stealing money and food from everyone, but theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre also over charging, theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre lying to customers to get a bigger tip saying things like ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂoh starting next week dd is only allowing cash tips...ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ or something along those lines, even though you tip online through the app, theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll claim it didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt go through and that thereÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs a glitch on the app. so beware. drivers are also staying home and sending their boyfriends/girlfriends to work for them which is not only shady and lazy, but also a bit unnerving to some especially if youÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre expecting a female and you see a black male come out instead.

1,i placed an order for my fiances bday for $150 worth of food. they charged me 9 times!!!! $1300 left our bank account during a pandemic!!!! we have bills to pay... instead of having a nice birthday we had stress... doordash already overcharges for everything as is. they sent me an email for me to show then the charges and they never responded. im hoping this gets resolved but this is not something i want to happen to me again or to anyone else.,8/3/2020 20:41,doordash,google,birth,email,,,0
1,"i placed an order to surprise my hubby for his birthday. when part of our 
order didn't turn up i discovered i had no way of contacting the restaurant 
or the driver to find out where the missing items were. instead you have to 
go through the ubereats customer service email system. their response is 
they can not refund you or get you your items. then they refuse to respond 
any further. so now i'm out of pocket money for the items that i ordered. 
very poor customer service!",7/7/2018 16:14,ubereats,google,birth,email,,,0
1,"immediately after receiving my order, i called back the driver to ask where my chopped salad was.  he told me i had to contact the restaurant, that he doesnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt check the bags, just takes what he is handed.  there was no answer at the restaurant, which closed shortly after this delivery.  when i tried getting help on the doordash app, i was offered a credit on future orders, only for the one missing item.  while they waived delivery fee, there was a service fee charged for about $3, and the prices were higher than menu prices, so they grossly overcharged and still provided poor service.  example, the salad they missed is $8.29 when ordered directly from portilloÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs, but $9.95 on doordash, plus service fee on top of the increased price.  this was the first time i have ordered on the app, and given this disaster, i do not intend to order again.  i have sent them an email demanding a refund instead.  i tried their chat, but was left waiting for 20 minutes, despite their site saying 2 minutes estimate.  i would call, but doordash does not offer a phone number for customers when you click help.

1,my 14 year old wanted food from our local taco place for his birthday. normally would have gone out but the pandemic says otherwise. ordered thru door dash around 5 with an estimated delivery time of 615. at 645 called the restaurant and door dash had not come yet to pick up food. the app would not load to say where driver was.  long story short i ended up driving to the restaurant myself to pick up our cold soggy taco birthday dinner. local taco place says we were one of 11 orders not picked up that night. only communication from door dash was generic email saying my order had been ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂcanceled.ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ ugh. never. again.,12/12/2020 5:36,doordash,apple,birth,email,,,0

1,the worst company to order your food and if you got a problem you have to email the company and wait for them to help you or not. then they hiring peoples that are scamming you and messing up the order then it too late because the company must be in on it they either give you half your money back or not which is terrible customer services. like no i spend 100 something for kfc for my step son birthday then want to give me 19 dollars back. i hope you guys are reading this you guys lost a customer i will never order from your scamming company again. they should have a customer service number shame on this company,7/17/2020 21:13,postmates,apple,birth,email,,,0

after i was forced to cancel an order because it was delayed five times and would've put the order at least 40 minutes later then originally stated and we had to leave for a birthday party.
one canceling the order, i tried to contact postmates to make sure my card wasn't charged as i don't feel it was my fault and having to cancel the order but the restaurants fault for not preparing it in the time they had told me it would be ready.
almost beside the point is the fact that post mates charge me for the canceled order even though the restaurant in question steve's cafÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ©, was extremely late in for filling the order. my real issue is that i could only submitted email and there was no actual phone number or person associated with customer service everything is done by a list of topics and if articles are helpful to me or not. i find this disheartening and completely unacceptable.

they messed up an important day, wasted my time as a resource, and i did not hear the end of it from my spouse.i would not recommend it to because when have issues itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs very difficult to address little things. i will stick with uber eats and i told them that they lost me as a permanent customer.",10/17/2020 17:37,doordash,apple,birth,location,,,0

i went ahead and placed another order for the same items but this time chose delivery. i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt see the credits that it said i can use for my next order. itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs my wife birthday and we were hungry. i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt want to spend the time chatting with doordash about it. so i figure i pay for the food now and talk to doordash about a refund later. 

when i chatted with a person from doordash, they told me they couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt refund me or give me any credits because when i cancelled the first order it was cancelled after i got the confirmation saying theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre going to prepare it. i told them ok, but i called the restaurant to let them know the situation and to prep only one order, not two and they understood that. i could understand if they had already made the first order and then i cancelled it, but thatÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs not what happen. the guy at doordash kept saying they couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt do anything because it was cancelled after it was confirmed. i kept saying the restaurant only made one order though and they knew exactly what i was trying to do. 

i never got my refund for my cancelled order. i ended up paying double for my order. the restaurant knew the whole time they were only making order for me and yet doordash still didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt want to refund me. i was a long time doordash user and also subscribed to dashpass. i will no longer be ordering from doordash and will unsubscribe to dashpass.",9/9/2020 3:50,doordash,apple,birth,,,,0

postmates never updates their menus so a lot of the time what we order isnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt even available. iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve reported this many times.

2,"if something does not satisfy or meet my expectations, i usually will give it one more shot before i'm completely done with whatever it may be. but for some reason i have given this app more than it's deserved chances. every time i use this app i am dissappointed. it can get very confusing because if you don't delete items the right way it will not let you go back and add items. it will just tell you the items are not available. it took me awhile before realizing that it wasn't that all the items were unavailable but that there was a certain way the app was wanting me to delete items from my cart. another major issue i have is that when i order items but want to add something that isn't already on that item , there is nowhere to message that , for example, i want to add mayo and extra mayo. also i have had every driver either not read the special instructions for what to do with my food or leave it in the wrong spot so i don't get my food(nor have i gotten a refund on a $60 check that i did not receive) or not read my order correctly that i need condiments and utensils and bring me absolutely none. so you can see how aggravating it can be. you would think there would be a way to change the refund policy if u did not receive ur food. i just can't understand having to pay $60 after waiting over an hour and never recieving my food.

1,"it was the night of my birthday. i was already having a pretty rough time spending all day moving into my new house; i didn't have a moment to just sit down and enjoy myself. finally, at the end of the night, when i finally finished, i decided to take it easy at my friends' house, ready to pass out from spending my birthday doing nothing but lifting heavy objects. naturally, i got hungry, and being way too tired to go get anything, i remembered someone told me about uber eats and i decided to give it a shot. 

now, some back story, i love milkshakes. one time i ordered two milkshakes from steak n shake and drank them in one sitting before we even drove back to the house.... i love milkshakes. but steak n shake was too far away, so i decided to order some food from mcdonald's and add a shake. the uber eats driver was perfectly nice, but she told me she didn't have the milkshake for me and that mcdonald's told her they had already called me and informed me that their milkshake machine was down. they didn't, though, because if they had i would have canceled the entire order anyway. the sandwich was dry and awful, the fries were too salty, and none of that even matters anyway because i really only wanted the milkshake in the first place. the only thing i wanted at the end of my birthday night and what did uber eats do?... refunded me $0.85. i'm 99% sure milkshakes at mcdonald's cost three times as much. so not only did uber eats not give me a refund on an order that was basically pointless and useless to me, they only refunded me a third of the value for an item i simply didn't even receive!

i can understand a bad delivery person/driver but to make things even worse door dash only partially refunded my money back only because ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂtheir system doesnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt allow them to view the entire totalÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ. i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt get my whole total spent through doordash; food total, delivery fee and even money i had tipped the driver. 
never using this app again, will go back to postmates or uber eats. 
i reached out to door dash customer chat service, that was horrible also the representative just wants to close your chat as quickly as possible and give you a fraction of what you paid before threatening to close the chat. 
beware when using this service!!!
make sure the person delivering to you has a working number, if your order doesnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt get delivered door dash will only refund you a portion of your total!!! 
post mates and uber eats may at times be a dollar or so more but do provide better customer service without running the risk of still paying for food that will never be delivered to you as this app door dash advertises to ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂdeliver food to your doorÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ.",11/2/2020 6:49,doordash,apple,birth,,,,0

1,ordered an archies from the trafford centre and the food arrived late and stone cold! paid for priority delivery and the driver told me that he waited for over 20 minutes because of another order. i got a notification regarding the delay due to them adding another order. the driver then appeared to park in a blocked off street and walked 800 yards to my house instead of just driving to the correct address in the 1st place. a lot money was spent on this food and a birthday tea was spoilt!,4/5/2021 14:21,ubereats,google,birth,,,,0
1,ordered birthday meal on website. food didn't turn up. had to download the app to be told it was cancelled. website still says it is coming. absolute rubbish - avoid at all costs. then looked at trust pilot and it is 95% terrible reviews.,5/10/2020 14:44,ubereats,google,birth,,,,0
1,ordered cake and ice cream for a birthday party and a frappe. the only thing the guy delivered was the frappe. the other items were coldstone creamery specialties that they make all of the time. the gentleman said stated that they ran out of these items. that doesnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt even make since because they make the ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂcookie doughnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt you want someÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ in store. when i called the store they said they had those items in stock. i wonÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt use this service again and i will tell others how much i dislike this delivery service.,3/9/2019 21:13,postmates,apple,birth,,,,0
1,ordered food first time ever for my wife's birthday. special instructions weren't followed. food was delivered and baked in the sun while a notification of completed drop off came in 4 minutes after i already had it. on top of this the driver put it directly in front of the screen door so there was no way to get it without tipping over $8 worth of drinks. worst experience ever. i will never support this company ever again. it took 45 minutes and btw u can't rate your order.,8/21/2020 7:56,doordash,google,birth,,,,0

1,"ordered food on vacation, renowned a text that the driver was arriving and stood outside on the side walk for 20 minutes, only to check the app to see that it was supposed delivered at the time i recieved the text. after an already 30 minute delay. it's almost dinner time. i guess i'll be going without until dinner on my birthday, thanks doordash.",9/11/2019 15:52,doordash,google,birth,,,,0
1,"our original delivery was missing half our order. we requested that the items missing (4 items) be replaced. the app said they would give us a ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂreplacement orderÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ at no extra charge (yay). our replacement order came almost an hour later and everything was cold/inedible. the notes on the food packages state that the items were from the original order (placed at 6:47pm), not from the replacement order. there was even a side item that we forgot to claim as missing that came with the replacement order, proving that this was just the missing food resent to us. it was unsafe to eat this food that didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt arrive until 8:30pm. this order was for a birthday. throwing away the food and we will never use this service again!",3/16/2019 3:57,doordash,apple,birth,,,,0

2,"pick up and delivery went great. i gave driver a 5.00 tip. i spent 50.00 on a chinese birthday dinner for myself. the food was terrible. i requested a refund and couldn't get a straight answer throughout 5 different chat sessions. took pictures of the food, told them it was cold and not worth the bag it was packed in. very frustrating. i was denied a refund. am deleting the app and won't be using city buffet, or ubereats again. will go to doordash instead. update: door dash sucks too",1/14/2021 22:24,ubereats,google,birth,,,,0

girlfriend's birthday to surprise her with breakfast. and they canceled the order with no reason. my girlfriend did not get her birthday breakfast and i'm left looking like an idiot. terrible service. unreliable.",12/8/2016 14:35,seamless,apple,birth,,,,0
1,"placed an order to be delivered to the hospital the day my wife gave birth. app/dasher lied that the order had been delivered 30 minutes early. then lied that it had been delivered on time. then claimed not to have seen an instruction to call a particular phone number. now redelivering is going to take an extra hour. all of this is compounded by the lack of any reasonable customer service process. no phone number, inadequate chat system.  the few other times i've tried the app, the best experience i've had is only a few missing items. 

for all of this terrible service, you can pay absurdly high fees to doordash that make it far more expensive than just going to the restaurant.",9/9/2017 0:52,doordash,apple,birth,,,,0
1,"placed my order and order was not delivered. only way to contact doordash was to download their app and use the online help. after doing that, all the online help offered to do was refund. no alternative solutions. no call or text was revived from the dasher whom they said tried to contact me. online help just kept repeating the same excuse. they feel i should be satisfied with the refund. what if this was a surprise for a birthday or special occasion. doordash you failed to come through.",10/10/2019 16:56,doordash,apple,birth,,,,0
1,"poor customer services experience. for my birthday thought i'd treat my wife and i to a takeaway meal once the baby was asleep. was a buy1get1free offer, ordered paid for it. took an 1hr40min to get here to start with and then they didn't have the ""1 free"" in the order so we sat with enough food for one person, great birthday test right? then when i let support know they refused to refund or even compensate us at all. they first claimed there was no bogo offer, send screenshots and still refused",5/28/2021 12:55,ubereats,google,birth,,,,0

1,"the app needs a way to disable ads from being sent through notifications. i want notifications on the delivery of food but not for ads. there is no way to turn them off so all notifications goto /dev/now. 

with the above said, doordashÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs business model needs to be tweaked. they up-charge on random products so you cannot tell what you are overpaying for. i understand the companies need to pull a profit to invest in making their product better but it also charges a service fee, tip, cut of revenue from the business, etc. i felt like i am paying double. this builds distrust amongst your customers and will result in them not wanting to use your service. each time i debate using doordash and effectively have given up on them except for very rare cases when i am at a party.

1,the orders you place are rarely what you get which is frustrating enough but you have to dispute the order right in the app which is fine but after some time they stop looking into it and just say they won't do anything never mind you pay like 60$ a pop to feed six people and one of your kids don't get their happy meal on their birthday postmates legit don't care. another side note you can provide a receipt from the food vendor showing you did not let what you ordered and they don't care still. also the prices never match you can order a large drink on the app and they send you a small size price as a large on the app . i've lost money using this app do yourself a favor and stick to uber eats they care if you don't get your stuff. i'm deleting postmates,9/22/2018 20:18,postmates,apple,birth,,,,0
1,"the unfortunate part is that this has happened before using this app. except this time, i ordered my friend her favorite meal for her birthday, waited two hours just for them to tell me they canceled my order because no one was available to pick it up. isnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt the sole purpose of this app to have drivers that will pick up the good and deliver it to you?? even if no one was available at a specific time in a specific area, donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt let me order and wait for it! they gave me a $5 credit as though that fixes the problem?? what is the $5 credit going to do if i go to use it and this happens again? this is absolutely ludacris, if i could give negative stars, i would. highly recommend using a different app or just get it yourself because whoever owns this app/company needs to reevaluate their position.",4/7/2021 20:52,postmates,apple,birth,,,,0

1,"tonight my girlfriend ordered some food from a certain restaurant through doordash. 

a little background; she is currently in medical school a few states away working herself halfway to death on a daily basis. her school has assumed an all online format because of the covid-19 pandemic which is an incredibly stressful combination. today is her birthday and all she wanted was a break from cooking after spending all day slaving over online lectures and memorizing countless flash cards. 

her food never made it from the restaurant to her house. at some point it just disappeared, an understandable mishap. doordash customer service essentially said, ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂoopsie, weÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll get you a refund in a week or so, good luck!ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ

way to take good care of a financially struggling medical student, who will be our future frontlines in crises like the one that we are in right now. all she wanted was food, and now sheÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs essentially fronting a $25 loan to a garbage company.

1,"yesterday i ordered four sandwiches (two chicken sandwiches and two burgers) and sides from lucy's to celebrate by nephew's 1st birthday with my fiance, my sister and her husband. we waited approximately an hour from order time for the much anticipated food to arrive. when the food did arrive, two of the sandwiches were missing. we reached out to the driver and he said he delivered what he was provided by the restaurant and to contact ubereats for additional support. upon contacting and reporting the two missing items, we were refunded for the two missing sandwiches. however, given this was 50% of our meal, two people had to reorder and wait for additional food to arrive for another hour. we had to pay additional service, delivery fees, and tip, with a different delivery service. the original food was cold and soggy given sandwiches and fries don't keep by the time the new food was delivered (as we politely waited for everyone at the birthday celebration to have food before eating). no one enjoyed the food given the lengthy wait, and the majority of it was tossed as the buns were soggy and fries had turned to a wet mush. we wouldn't have ordered at all had we known that we would only receive 50% of our meal. i understand and appreciate refunding the food that did not arrive; however, as a result of only 50% of the food arriving, the remainder of the meal was ruined. i am overall very disappointed in the experience and am not satisfied with paying for two soggy burgers and fries. we clearly would never have spent a dime on ubereats if we knew this would be the experience. 

update: i have had to provide the details of my issues to customer service over four times now. each time i am told they already resolved the issue or that i need to reprovide details. no one has been able to resolve it and it seems like maybe the responses are automated and not even real customer service reps as no one acknowledges any of the details of my case. i am furious.",7/5/2020 23:49,ubereats,apple,birth,,,,0

1,"they spammed me asking to download in exchange for a $5 coupon on my first app order.  i did what they asked.

as i tried to check out i found out that the coupon, set to expire in four days, was not a valid code.  ok, the store had a similar coupon so it wasn't that terrible.

the next issue was entering a credit card.  it wasn't intuitive and it took several tries to enter a code.  the first option i tried was the camera was a continuous fail that crashed every time i tried to use it.  eventually i just entered the code by hand but it isn't set up well.

all in all, it wasn't worth my time.  they should not offer coupons unless they're actually going to work.

just for you! $10 off at xxx restaurant if you order $30 of food.

1,"i was a loyal customer for a while. i paid the unlimited membership for years, and used the service frequently, probably spending thousands a year too (which is embarrassing ha). from time to time i would have an issue with an order, like ordering a smoothie with an order and they would bring the order but forget the drink. and the one-off cases were handled well and i was refunded. but recently there was a week span where all of the drivers were just regularly messing up. i think like 5 orders in a row had an issue - from the driver delivering to wrong address, to one not finding the address and literally leaving it in on the road not even next a building, to forgetting the smoothie again or giving me the wrong item. i was so fed up with the app and tried to figure out how i could rate these drivers and it only gives me the option to tip but not to rate drivers or give feedback like you can do on uber. i think this is a major flaw (take note someone please!!!). 

the big hiccup for me is that instead of postmates resolving these issues with the drivers and me, they flagged my account and started refusing my conflict requests. in other words, they thought i was scamming them and are punishing me for the mistakes of the drivers. i got royally unlucky having 5 crappy deliveries back to back. i donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt understand how they didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt go through the process of contacting the drivers to hear from them that items werenÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt delivered. i had to pay for items i never got to eat. i think it would be a great idea for them to implement the photo delivery feature that instacart has so that if a smoothie is ordered when itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs delivered they take a photo and prove its there. i feel like sometimes they do take photos and sometimes they donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt but it should always be required. regardless, i am pretty floored that after years paying their unlimited subscription and spending thousands of dollars, that after a few messed up orders by their drivers they blame me and stop resolving my issues. if that many conflicts are occurring back to back donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt you think you should be in touch with the drivers and the client to figure out whatÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs happening?? shouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt it be your job to figure out why it is and whoÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs to blame? rather than automatically blaming the customer who has been contributing to your profits for years? i donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt get it. i emailed multiple times explaining the situations and even providing video camera footage of the deliveries showing they werenÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt holding a smoothie or the time of night it was delivered and that there was no delivery and i did not receive a single email reply. 
and this is dumb in comparison but i also had a rite aid order from 3 months ago that was never fulfilled and itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs still pending and if i cancel it it will charge me $15. i cant even reach anyone to address it. 
i have such a hard time understanding a business model that doesnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt respect their loyal customers. when you have a customer investing in your business you should certainly treat them a lot better than this. i think the most frustrating thing of all though is the inability to be heard and reach someone. itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs as if they have some kind of motto ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂif they canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt reach you, they canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt complain and then youÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve done nothing wrongÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ. my advice - save your money and your effort and use another service. this ones great until thereÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs an issue. not what you want said about your business.",4/15/2021 5:41,postmates,apple,camera,email,,,0

1,"please read all the way through before using.

this is the third and finally issue i have had with uber eats. please read the finally complaint they will ever receive from me.
yes, this is a true story, yes i am still waiting for it to be resolved.

regardless of your level of influence, you have stolen from me. at a little before 11pm on saturday march 2 i placed an order through you in confidence that i would receive said order in a timely manner. after waiting forty minutes for door bell to ring i checked my phone for any missed calls to my delight there was one, a single one, one single call, no texts no follow ups, no door bell. you know that strange contraption people used to use to get someoneÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs attention from behind a closed door. you know if the door was closed... the one that has a camera on it that can see that nobody attempted to make contact with the address my food was supposed to arrive at. oh did you catch that?? yeah our front door was open the whole time and have been in the living room since the order was made. all i want is my goddamn food, and i want it hot. and i want it 30 minutes ago. your prompt attention is of your utmost importance.
ps. should you have a delivery service that runs 24/7 you really should look into having a number customers can call when they get screwed by uberÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs shotty background checks

pps called the uber eats support, sent to another number, then another, and still no help

this is just one of three instances, in another i was supposed to receive my food from someone in a blue late model honda accord but pulled up in a mid 90s tan honda civic loaded down with hoarded trash, and on another account the driver was sent to an address i had never even heard of.

unless a prompt and direct refund or delivery is made correctly, this will be the last time any uber brand receives my business. as this is the third time in as many attempts to work with uber that they have fallen short, i will never recommend this company to anyone. this companyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs professionalism and customer service extends as far as taking the money from your account and leaving you with empty bellies and no solutions.

update: two hours later, no email response, no call, no text... still hungry, still still missing money that you stole...

update: it is now 8:50a pst i was finally able to find the support number (you can not find it in the app, you must look it up online) after being sent to the wrong department, i was finally sent to marlot in their claims department, who was extremely unhelpful, i may as well have been speaking to a recording. they were so bad at handling this call and they kept repeating the same stupid dialogue, that i completely lost it over the phone and demanded i speak to the supervisor.

let me tell you about this supervisor, the last employee i spoke to was a brick wall, whatever the driver says was the word of god. but not princess. no, princess read my complaint, listened to the evidence, and made an actual critical assessment of the situation. as needless as it should be to say in an instance where the driver was derelict in their duties, i will be refunded my money. after what seemed like 3 tooth extractions and a root canal, princess did make amends to their subpar hiring system.

in short, if you get screwed by an uber deliverer remember this.

1. if you miss the call you can not simply redial the number it was received from.

2. do not expect the driver to make any attempt whatsoever to ensure you receive your food outside of the single call the will make from the cross street of your neighborhood.

3. although their policies say the driver will deliver your food to your door, they will not.

4. if you order past 9p est do not expect to receive your food or any customer service whatsoever.

5. should your driver make no attempt at delivery be prepared to lose that money or prepare for the verbal barrage of your life because any subtle or polite demeanor is seen as weakness and they will try to keep your money.

6. just use a different service, save time, save your money, avoid ever having to deal with these people at all costs. 

if you are thinking of using uber eats contemplate this experience and ask yourself is the $2 more difference in delivery fee worth all this extra baggage.",3/3/2019 17:14,ubereats,apple,camera,email,,,0

1,"we ordered food totally $48, with instructions to type a code in at the gate to our apartment. the driver pulled by the gate, and drove off 10 seconds later without dropping the food off. the order said it was completed, and the picture of where the food was dropped off looked like the driver put his finger over his camera and took a picture.

there appeared to be no way to speak to someone on the phone for this, only email. they wonÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt give a refund, only credit for other postmates orders. unable to refund any tips either.

will never use this again. suggest looking at reviews online, since the reviews on appstore do not seem to have accurate ratings to their stories.

1,"after giving doordash repeated second chances, i'm done. more than half the time there has been an issue with the order, whether it be missing items, wrong items, cold food, late deliveries, etc. last night, we ordered chinese, only to have the order cancelled well before the listed closing time; not an uncommon occurrence. trying again, we ordered barbecue. almost immediately after the order was picked up, we got a notification that the driver had arrived and couldn't find us. the in-app gps map showed the driver moving down the main road at speed, not far from the restaurant. a few minutes later, i get a message saying the driver left the food at our doorstep. the map never showed him entering the neighborhood, and none of the myriad motion sensors and cameras in front of my house saw anyone come down our street. doordash is quick to issue refunds, but never takes any action against sloppy and dishonest restaurants or drivers. doordash doesn't even have a reachable customer service department; they're more than happy to call you when they want more money because their menu was wrong, but you can't call them when there's an issue. judging by the response i got when i closed my account, they aren't sad to see me go, and frankly the feeling is mutual.",5/22/2019 21:55,doordash,apple,camera,gps,,,0

1,"i have had so many deliveries that were incorrect and missing items. 90% of the time if iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm just missing one item i never report it because mistakes happen. however, lately the drivers have been bad. i ordered today and got the completely wrong order and when i told the driver that it wasnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt my name on the bag they said that had taken pictures to prove me wrong, however my name certainly isnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt shuntell. the driver was so rude for their mistake and the food i received had everything on it that i canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt eat. i always tip well since i am a former server, however itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs not fair that you canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt tip after you get the order. i certainly wouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt have tipped after getting screamed at and having the driver call me up and have his girlfriend cuss me out. also, i watched on the app where the driver was sitting at a down the road at a gas station for 20 minutes before arriving to my house with the wrong order and the food ice cold. also on the same day, my friends who live 15 minutes from me ordered doordash and their food said delivered and they never received it. they watched the gps and the driver came no where near the house and marked it delivered. they called the driver and the driver said she was lost and was trying to gps again but they waited 30 minutes after and received nothing. when they moved i had to gps to their house and never had an issue. itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs actually a really easy neighborhood to navigate and literally on the first street in the neighborhood and only one way to enter the community. i think cameras need to be used inside the vehicle. so many times i have had a delivery and 4 people are in the car. who knows what they are doing to your food! they also state they canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt open the food to check your order but i have received so many unsealed food orders that still have been wrong which makes me wonder if it was stolen. doordash used to be great but now itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs becoming every single time i order something (and i donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt order a lot anymore like i used to because of all the mistakes) that something is incorrect with my order.",3/29/2021 0:10,doordash,apple,camera,gps,,,0
1,"i have ordered from ubereats numerous times. itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs safe to say that 1 out of 10 orders goes smoothly. the other 9.... disastrous!! there have been many problems. first, drivers taking so long to get you the food that by the time it gets to you itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs cold and most foods do not taste the same if they are microwaved. itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs not going to be as hot as if you went straight to the restaurant and ate-in but if the drive from the place to your house is literally a 5 minute drive there is no excuse for the driver to take 20-30 minutes to ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂdriveÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ to your house. 

second, i have literally had drivers steal my food!! i have come to find out that they literally have drivers who only sign up to become an ubereats driver so they can act as if they are going to do deliveries and take the food and then on the gps portion of the app where you can see the delivery drivers car they move around for 10-15 minutes in the same place and then the order just disappears. i have tried calling ubereats so called ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂcustomer serviceÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ and they wouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt give me my money back (which is really crappy) but the worst absolute worst part of this is... the theifs get away with it!! i have not heard of a single incident (not the news, not through hearsay, nothing) where a driver who committed theft of a customers food was either fired or arrested. this is insane. they at the very least should be fired. these drivers that do it also do it multiple times so it would not be hard to look up the complaints, call the restaurant where the food was ordered and then stolen, then simply ask a manager if they have camera footage from that day and time when the driver picked it up. 

anyways, i hate taking even more time out my own day to complain about something that is not even getting fixed. i am so shocked to see that this app is rated 4.8 out of 5 stars as of today. if you are reading this review please please try another app that delivers food before giving this app any of your money. thanks for reading.",6/30/2018 12:37,ubereats,apple,camera,gps,,,0
2,"i used this service for a long time, i loved it. but something went wrong at some point this year. 
first issue i had was when i ordered food for pickup and i received the notification my food was ready when it wasnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt. showed up to pick up my food and i had to wait 30+min. this happened twice. 
second problem (different place) i showed up to pick up my food and even though the order was ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂconfirmedÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ and i got a notification that it was ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂreadyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ they had no idea what i was talking about when i asked for my food. 
third time was a charm. i ordered food for delivery, watched the carrier through gps (on a bicycle) make it all the way to my block, stop about 4-5 houses down and cancel the order. said they were unable to deliver. never tried, never even came close to my house. i have cameras everywhere so i confirmed it.

went with tacobell, ordered 3 burritos, checked out and boom 25 bucks and 30 minutes. okay convenience fee, whatever still worth it. 

after about an hour of checking the app, i noticed the driver getting close. i figured it would take longer because the photo of the driver (mind you it does not say the vehicle) was of a baby with dreadlocks, so the baby is probably having a hard time seeing over the steering wheel. 

new text message! ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂhi this your grubhub driver, iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve left your food at the doorÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ. weird, iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm watching my camera and that is a lie. couple minutes later some older looking guy whoÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs tattered clothes with no signs of ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂgrubhubÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ anywhere is here. and not even wearing a mask! nice! 

grab the from him, and oh what do you know? the bag isnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt sealed! i donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt live off taco bell, however any time iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve gone to this location or any others since the ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂrona, every single bag is sealed when i receive it. 

i called taco bell, and it turns out the manager was the one dealing with orders and sealing bags that day, and i made it clear to the worker on the phone i needed to speak to the person who has been sealing the bags, (the manager). after speaking to this manager, my inner karen was satisfied as they swore up and down not one bag is allowed to leave that store without being sealed, no matter what.

armed with this new information, i called the driver. hmm this time a man doesnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt answer, but a woman. hey maybe itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs the actual person from the photo of my grub hub delivery driver, remember the baby with dreads? sweet! 

ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂhello, when you picked up the bag from taco bell, was it sealed?ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ 

ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂnaah i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt open any bag it wasnt sealedÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ

(weird did you even see the bag? a woman definitely walk it to my door but whatever, okay bye, click).

at this point the foods in the trash. i call grubhub and tell them what happened and yay! 20% off my next order!  app deleted and went to the grocery store. 

tldr:
i know people who work in restaurants who absolutely despise grubhub orders and having to clean up after all the grubhub ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂemployeesÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ  screw ups.

recently we used dd at our neighbors house. when the food came i grabbed it since i paid. it was a dasher i'd had before. he told me he works for other delivery places as well. he then told me he could do other shopping for me if i needed like home depot or costco. i proceeded to tell him that wouldn't be necessary but he gave me a card. two days later in the middle of the afternoon he showed up at our neighbors house looking for me. they weren't home at first but  have security cameras and he was there for 15 minutes. when i wrote a complaint to dd stating what happened and i would no longer order through them knowing i could potentially get this unprofessional dasher again they emailed me back a generic letter stating an apology for my service with a $4.99 credit to my account for a free delivery the next time i use them. um no thanks. i prefer my safety, peace of mind and non-creepers only!",10/17/2016 5:25,doordash,apple,camera,security,email,,0
1,"so, today i tried ordering from this local mexican restaurant that actually has great food, so no complaints there. but, the problem is that when i tried ordering from grubhub my food never came. i was at my address waiting the entire time, even looking out my window and no one ever showed up. i noticed it was a few minutes late and iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm still waiting and then suddenly i get a message saying it has already been delivered. well, again i never got it so i contact the restaurant to ask if the delivery guy from grubhub ever picked up my order and the restaurant told me yes, and that it should have been there already and to contact grubhub. so, then i contacted grubhub through their live chat and instead of giving me a refund they decide to give me 20% off my next order instead. thatÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs stolen money. also, if someone actually did arrive at my house with the delivery, even if they did not ring the door bell i would have still gotten a notification telling me that someone was at the door because we have alarm sensors and security cameras set up at my house. i also have a dog who barks really loudly whenever someone comes to our door, so like i said no one ever showed up. the driver also did not try contacting me as he claimed to grubhub. i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt get any emails from him or phone calls. no texts. nothing. at this point the only theory i have now is that this particular driver either went to the wrong address (since thereÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs a street with a similar name just a few blocks away) or he decided to take my food for himself and pretended to deliver it. either way, itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs unacceptable and the customers shouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt be punished for it. also, after chatting with a rep online i decided to call instead and again they refused a refund but i was able to get a 50% discount which in my opinion is still unacceptable. when you spend money, youÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre supposed to receive what you paid for. i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt get anything i paid for. instead i got robbed and this is why grubhub only gets one star from me. if possible iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂd give them negative stars. i will not be using their service ever again after this horrible experience.",3/4/2020 20:49,grubhub,apple,camera,security,email,,0

my fourth try, the order said delivered all of the sudden while the driver wasnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt even visible on the map.  there is no way given to make contact with the driver, so i contacted uber support.  they said it was filed very quickly and needed confirmation the delivery didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt arrive.  ok..  next thing, theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre claiming that a) the delivery driver did indeed arrive and b) called 11 times - what a number - but somehow my working phone didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt pick this up.  before giving up too much info i confirmed the driver claimed to have been outside my building calling.  at this point i informed them i have security cameras all over my building and access to a weekÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs history, and would produce my call records as well.  they insinuated i was lying until i reiterated these statements, asked for an email to send video evidence or phone records to, and was suddenly put on hold.  after about 5 minutes i got a prewritten ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂsorry there was an error messageÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ informing me theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂd refund it.  no acknowledgement of their implication nor the distinct possibility the driver simply stole my food and thought he could get away with it (when i said i would dispute the charge i also asked do they not have gps data on driver locations, this was also unanswered).  oh, and i had to pay in full for a second order for a still open restaurant.

i let it be with my asked-for feedback saying the customer service was poor and it seems the driver just lied.  people are jerks, so that can happen.  however, the very next order, half of it was missing, and when i brought up the fact that i was still unhappy about the previous order and not satisfied with simply not paying, when missing half an order when sharing is nearly as bad as missing it altogether, unless i want my company to sit and starve while i eat or vice versa. they didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt care and simply said theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂd hope iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂd try again, refunding nothing more than the missed items, also putting me in a position where i feel obligated to tip for poor service.  i worked for an early multi-restaurant delivery company, i understand the complexities, but good lord how do you not check an order?  thatÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs the best version - worst is theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre just trying to eat on my dime.

so far door dash has been brilliant though! the gui is better, alerts are better, and not one issue out of a bunch of orders, meaning iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm already a lot more understanding when one happens.

perhaps itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs the fact you canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt tip ahead so drivers assume you wonÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt tip well or something, idk, lord knows iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve always tipped uber drivers well and have a good rating though.

iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll tell you this much ue - i wonÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt be trying you again, not unless all your competition goes out of business, and even then, maybe iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂd just drive more.  thatÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs how bad the experience was.  imagine only ever getting half your order at a restaurant - they donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt charge you, but you gotta pay extra to get what you originally wanted.  staying in business? no.  good luck uber",3/11/2019 1:30,ubereats,apple,camera,security,location,gps,0

1,"looking back on my history, i have had less than 20% of my food actually delivered. the other 80% of the time, typically, a worker from the establishment from which the food was ordered claims that i was ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂnot presentÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ to receive the order and then cancels the order... at a 5$ cancelation fee and loss of the money paid for the food. this is a scam... do not use. uber is not helpful, and actually obstructing getting funds back for food never even delivered. as mentioned, the security cameras of my building never showed anyone trying to deliver any food.
i will be mentioning this to all my family, friends, colleagues and patients.

1,first experience was great. but don't be a human being and make a mistake in which address you have it delivered to because they will not try at all to help cancel the order. they will not refund or credit you as a good faith gesture. they will tell you they can cancel it but you won't get your money back. or you can watch your delivery driver on your ring camera leave at your doorstep and you hard earned money is sitting on your porch in the rain wasting away. i would recommend grubhub!,8/13/2019 10:14,doordash,google,camera,,,,0

1,"i have had some of the worst experiences with this company. i have used them for quite awhile now and twice my food has just not shown up but shown that it was delivered on the app. the first time they tried to blame me and say that i wasnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt there and didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt answer my phone calls when i never received phone calls nor did the driver ever show up. the delivery was sent to my work and we have cameras and they changed their story very quickly when i said i checked the cameras and the driver never even came here. they then tried to refuse to refund my money and basically act like it was my fault when the driver clearly took my food and never showed up with it at all. finally after fighting with them they agreed to refund my money.

then again, today i ordered food and it said it was delivered at 2:12. i started a chat with an agent at 2:18 stating that my food never arrived even though it said it did. they then said that the driver was here and gave my food to a girl sitting on a couch. the delivery was set to come to my work and we have no couches in my work and also have cameras and once again the driver was never here.

iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm sick of wasting money trying to order food from this company and will most likely not use them again. i have multiple family members and friends who iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve told about this app and i will also make sure to now tell them the bad experiences iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve had so they no longer order from door dash either. absolutely ridiculous.

update: gave them a few other chances because itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs easier to have food delivered to work than leave to get it and still have nothing but issues with this company. constantly not sending all of our food, have tried to refuse to give me credit for food i never got. you just lost yourself a lot of business because no one at my work will use you again after the terrible experiences weÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve had. literally nothing but issues",2/19/2021 19:00,doordash,apple,camera,,,,0
1,"i have ordered from this app a total of 10 times. i keep giving it a try even though every single time i do i say i never will again. 7/10 times i have ordered, the order has been incorrect or missing items. 4/10 times i have had a delivery person who has been so rude that it blew my mind. considering that you are literally only knocking on a door and handing a person food (five whole seconds of human interaction), you really have to try hard in order to be rude to that person. i didn't know it was really possible until i tried this app. i have had a driver yell at me for saying hello to them. you think i'm joking? i'm not. the driver arrived at my house. i opened the door. i said ""hi."" she immediately started yelling at me for ""treating her that way."" i'm 99% sure there were a bunch of hidden cameras around and i'm about to be the star of a prank show. 

i also really hate that the times i have had a really great, friendly delivery person, i felt i undertipped them because you're required to tip before delivery, so i always tip lower than i would have if i were tipping upon delivery. 

i would highly suggest sticking with postmates. i never had an incorrect order or a rude driver with them, you tip after delivery, and you can order from anywhere.

1,i have recently learned the hard way that when using door dash they take the word of their dasher over yours. my order was never delivered and i have a camera for proof but they refuse to refund me my money. please do yourself a favor and donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt use this service.,4/22/2021 14:05,doordash,apple,camera,,,,0

1,i have used many services to get food delivered to me since my youngest has a weak immuned system. never have i ever seen what i saw in my camera. guy drops off order but not before eating my fries as he walks up to deliver 1hr late!... i called and asked for refund and their customer service just said you got your food so we can not reimburse you besides the fries.... i can not chance getting my child sick so i have turned this over to the food & beverage inspection place with video.,5/7/2021 2:40,doordash,google,camera,,,,0

1,"i ordered a pizza but i received the wrong order.  originally, i thought no big deal errors happen, so i attempt to report a problem.  i follow the prompts and one of the prompts requires the user to submit photographic evidence of the incorrect order.  again, no big deal.  i snap a photo of the erroneous order in the app and their is an error , so i open my camera take a pic and then try to upload it instead and again the app errored out.  now, iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm beginning to lose my patience a bit because the smell of the food is making me hungry and iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm stumbling around with an app.  i attempt to call customer service and, apparently, there is no phone support and a phone prompt indicates that all issues must be resolved through the app.  i re-enter the app, attempt to report the issue in a different manner and again photographic evidence is required but, this time, there is an option for those that donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt have a photo.  after selecting this option, a form appears where you put your contact information and a customer service rep will be in touch.  itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂd been about 30 mins, all of the restaurants were closing, and i still hadnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt heard anything so i decided to contact the restaurant.  the restaurant apologized profusely for the error and explained that when the order transmitted some of the ingredients were abbreviated in a misleading fashion.  i informed them that i already logged an issue with uber.  the restaurant told me to, please, contact them back if the issue was not resolved by uber so they could attempt to correct it from their side.

never, ever will i use uber eats nor uber ride share again!  this experience is, by far, one of the worst customer service experiences i have ever encountered. after posting this review, i will be contacting a few friends that are restaurant owners and urge them to pull their support for uber eats.  business are already struggling with this pandemic and they do not need poor reviews from a sloppy, third-party delivery service.",8/5/2020 1:22,ubereats,apple,camera,,,,0

most of the time the food is good, but is handled poorly, and the common cause seems to be any dish with a sauce or juices. while some of the dashers handle it well, itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs mostly delivered with sauce or juices spilled out in the bags and into other food items within the bags. i have a doorbell camera, and after my most recent order, i watched the video and saw the dasher set the food down, then return all of the items in the bags to upright positions prior to ringing the doorbell as if all is well, when itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs visibly obvious everything is spilled in the bags. iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve also had dashers that completely did not match the name on the app of the person delivering my order. 

further, when addressing my order issues on the app, it does not allow you to report all of the issues, but rather one. if iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm missing items that i paid extra for and the service was poor, i can only report one or the other, not both. i contacted customer service via chat to let doordash know of the actual issues, and they asked me for details. i was typing out my response, and less than one minute later, they ended the chat because they ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂhadnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt heard from me in some timeÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ and that was it.

this last time however, i did not receive my delivery and when i reported it they ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂinvestigatedÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ me. i wanted a refund or a reorder for the food i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt receive. they denied me both because i ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂhave too much compensationÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ on my account. they tried to say my food was delivered so i offered that i have camera footage from my workplace that no door dasher had walked in and handed me my food. no one responded to this and they continued to deny my a refund. so they got my money, i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt get food, and they ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂinvestigatedÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ me twice because i responded when i was told that the dasher handed me food. 
could have fooled me since i was helping customers left and right doing my job. i think i would have noticed a bag of food rather than a furniture order. 
so i had them deactivate my account completely. if they are going to steal my money then iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm not using them. it is a scam.",7/6/2020 2:21,doordash,apple,camera,,,,0

1,"i signed up and used the app to order food after driving for ubereats a couple times. i wanted to be a customer to see how the experience was. everything was great for a while. then a few days ago i signed out of the app so i could create a new account for work (and use a corporate credit card under my managers name). well, that went horribly wrong! 1) tried to do this on the website on a browser, and it failed. so many bugs!!! too many to go into here. however, one very annoying bug was it telling me a restaurant was in my area and then getting an order for 10 people entered in from said restaurant only to try to complete the order and it tell me the restaurant is not in my area. what the hell!? 2) signed out of my acct on my phone and logged in with the new account i made. got my order placed and it declined the order  saying something was wrong with the card. turns out it was because the name on the card didn't match the name on the acct. please allow for cards with different names than that on the ubereats acct! i ended up not using ubereats for our work event. and lastly, 3) when i tried to sign back in to my personal account for ubereats on my cell it starts asking me for a verification code before i can order again. but it never sends me a code, or i get the code a day or 2 later. no joke! so now i can't even use the service. i tried getting on chrome on my iphone. and still had to put in a verification code i still have not received. i must be insane because this is the 2nd time i've tried ordering. i still have not received the codes requested last night.

so tonight instead of having the indian food we both really wanted, my fiancÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ© and i will now be taking our business elsewhere. if you can fix these bugs, i will use this service again but as it stands, 2 nights in a row, i've not been able to use your service because of this issue. and yes, before you even ask, i've tried deleting and reinstalling the app, i've made sure the app is up to date, and i've even tried changing the number the code is sent to. i'm still waiting for my codes.",3/16/2017 0:29,ubereats,apple,credit card,,,,0

1,if i could give them zero stars i would. not once but twice in a row have they messed up my order and promised me a full refund. only to then give me a partial refund which i am still waiting to see supposedly change on my credit card. they say it takes 5 to 10 days. then offer me some kind of money off for another order but it this point i don't ever want to use them again. they're unreliable and direct her to get a hold of. i'm considering calling my credit card company and canceling the payments as i don't believe i can trust them to amend the payments as they say they well. overall. do not use this app.,6/11/2016 21:41,postmates,apple,credit card,,,,0

initially service worked, but now not worth the time or trouble, first off running current ios and app,  in attempting to order app hangs give error yet your credit card is charged.. and no order was placed, or delivered.
in attempting to resolved you can only email a ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂcomplaintÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ which i did.
received a email back at 10:30pm i relied back in the morning (sleep) with the requested information and promptly got a email saying the case was closed(no resolution).. i have since tried 3 times to file  send a complaint again from their worthless  web site and have got the confirmed green check that was sent and have been ignored with no reply .. so i have contacted my bank to dispute charges and will not recommend or ever use this company again..

2,"in short, uber eat is worse in every aspects compare to doordash. iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve given uber eat a few tries because my credit card gives me monthly credit with uber. experiences werenÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt positive, i wouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt recommend uber eat to anyone.

i live in an apartment complex, uber eatÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs official policy was they donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt deliver to the door, you have to meet the drivers. 75% times, drivers couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt even find where my building is. this wouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt be an issue if not for doordash has been consistently able to locate my building and leave my food at my door every time except for once. (i have like 30 orders with doordash)

then there was the incident last week that prompted this review. i ordered subway from uber eat, and local popcorn chicken 15 mins later from doordash.(my wife and i like different food). half an hour later, my doordash order was delivered, and i thought to just check on the status on uber eat delivery. it was marked at as delivered, with no communication, nothing from the driver, and nothing at the door or anywhere i can look. so, intuitively, i looked to see if i can find a way to contact the driver from the app. answer is no. then, i was like, okay, itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs frustrating, but now i have to contact customer support. to my surprise, not even a phone number is available for customer support. itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs basically a form i had to fill and state the situation, and it said on the form after they investigate they will get back to me. now, a week from then, no communication, nor any update from ubereat. which means, the result was i paid uber eat and the driver, but ended with nothing and also lost my money. 

i hope they can resolve my issue and improve services since they were the og gig company and all. but honestly, looking at their leadership and priorities, itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs probably not going to happen. my advice for anyone who read this far is just use doordash for the peace of mind, at least it should be good until after they go public.",4/11/2020 18:07,ubereats,apple,credit card,,,,0
1,"instead of the refund going back onto your debit or credit card used, the refund is given as a door dash credit. i donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt plan on using the app anytime soon ,and would like my money refunded back onto the card i used initially. i do not want a gift card or door dash credit. also, many restaurants do not have a place to submit requests in regards to items purchased ie:requesting to have certain ingredients taken out of the food because of allergies or etc. there are also certain restaurants that donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt take heed to the requests made if able to receive them, and the food received is wasted because it can not be eaten. upsetting.",5/16/2020 3:55,doordash,apple,credit card,,,,0

1,"postmates does not offer the proper transparency to protect their customers from restaurants charging hidden fees. i ordered what appeared to be a 30 dollar order soon balooned to 78 dollars charged to my credit card.
according to postmates, the restaurant, which is not one of their ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂpartner restaurantsÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ is allowed to charge marked up prices for their food and included a 15 percent service fee (tip) without my authroization which turned my 30 dollar ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂestimated orderÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ into a 48 dollar actual order. 
for context, i looked on the menu of the restaurant i ordered from online and the items i ordered would have amounted to 27ish dollars if i ordered in person. then on top of that postmates charges me their own ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂservices feeÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ which is another 15 percent. then you include postmates charging  tax, tip(15%), and a delivery fee then next thing you know i am paying 78 dollars for 30 dollars worth of food. 
after talking to customer service, they told me to use their partner restaurants in the future to prevent something like this from happening. 
i want to be clear, this lack of transparency with customers and lack of solutions to this simple problem is not just negligence, itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs theft. to allow a restaurant to do this just because they are not partnered with you is manipulating customers to use restaurants that postmates approves of (is partnered with) is a conscious decision with a clear solution. 
postmates isnt rated 1 star on google with over 100 reviews for nothing, until their policies improve postmates does not deserve to do business by screwing over its customers and pinning the blame of restaurants.",11/28/2020 21:26,postmates,apple,credit card,,,,0

then, when the delivery man showed up, half of my entire order was missing. i called the restaurant and they confirmed the rest of the order never went through and told me to contact postmates as it was a mistake on postmates' end.

i called postmates 1-800 number and received a voicemail saying someone could get back to me within twenty minutes - which they did not. i sent an email complaint, which took forever to get a response to.

1,"there are several things wrong with doordash and they are mainly related to the way they operate, specially the ""benefits"" from having a dashpass membership

-first, i have noticed that for some restaurants, prices are more expensive than the prices for same items at the same restaurants in other delivery apps. so whatever money you think you think you are saving in delivery/service fees, you are paying it in the food 

-second, for some reason, the dashpass is something that only works with some restaurants, not all of them. in my city, only half of the restaurants are included under dashpass. why do i have to pay a membership for a service that only works half of the time? there are other apps that the pass applies to all the restaurants

-third, some days, there will be restaurants that show up as ""closed"" earlier than on other apps, and you will be forced to order from a different restaurant or from that same restaurant on another delivery app

-fourth, and more importantly, they try to fool you with discounts. for example, they offer a 10% discount on your order at local restaurants on saturdays (and by they way, it only applies to up to $5 off your order). if you try to check out quickly and you don't pay attention, you won't notice that by using the promo code for that discount, they automatically remove your service fee discount that you are supposed to have always for ordering at dashpass restaurants. that is really sketchy. 

i really really dislike this delivery app, and the only reason i have a dashpass is because my stupid credit card forced me into it for some reason that i don't understand because having a membership with them is seriously the opposite of a ""benefit""",6/10/2020 2:51,doordash,apple,credit card,,,,0

ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂkayla l.ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ was actually a black male. so not only are they stealing money and food from everyone, but theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre also over charging, theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre lying to customers to get a bigger tip saying things like ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂoh starting next week dd is only allowing cash tips...ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ or something along those lines, even though you tip online through the app, theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll claim it didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt go through and that thereÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs a glitch on the app. so beware. drivers are also staying home and sending their boyfriends/girlfriends to work for them which is not only shady and lazy, but also a bit unnerving to some especially if youÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre expecting a female and you see a black male come out instead.

1,"decided to have a cozy night in with my husband. we thought we would try this app for a change and order in some local thai. the initial email upon ordering was 52 minutes. at first i thought the app was quite cool how it had a timeline and capability to contact the delivery person. after about an hour of the app saying the driver was at the restaurant, i tried contacting him and the number didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt work. the app kept extending the amount of time it was taking to get to my house. mind you, the restaurant was only about 10 minutes from our house. finally i tried calling the restaurant but it was closed at this point. so i used the app to contact customer support. they said they would cancel the order and refund the cost. they blamed the driver for being unprofessional. after a few minutes my credit card was charged a second time for the same amount instead of getting a refund. i was unable to contact customer support on the app anymore because there was no order history. so i had to search a phone number to contact them to resolve my credit card issue. they said the only resolution was to send them a screen shot of my credit card statement before i could be refunded the double charge. so i am starving, date night ruined, charged $49 twice for no food. donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt use this app. next time i will hold off on drinking a glass of wine and drive to the thai place myself. worst experience with an app ever.",9/23/2018 2:58,doordash,apple,email,credit card,,,0

1,"i ordered food on june 13th, and it didn't deliver to my address, so i asked them to reorder my food to my address, but they just sent me credit for it to use for my next order, not refund to my credit card, which was unacceptable for me because i didn't want this to happen again when i order food. (but they didn't review my concern and just sent me credit)

i received email that says it expires on july 14th, and i ordered food on july 14th not to waste my money and credit, and the credit didn't apply because they said the credit has already expired, even though the email i received says the credit expires july 14th.

i contacted to customer service again with my new issue, but they just keep saying all the credit expires in 30 days, so they can't give me refund.

this is completely unacceptable because the email i received said it expires july 14th. 

i sent the proof which was the screenshot of the email, but they keep saying the credit has already expired.

this is not my fault, this is their fault sending me the email. 

this customer service is messed up.

i just want my money to be back, but they donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt try to solve my problem.",7/16/2020 19:31,postmates,apple,email,credit card,,,0
1,"not only are their delivery charges ridiculous, but should you ever have any kind of problem it will be literally impossible to contact them. any attempts will direct you to an email system that could take 24 to 48 hours for them to respond. which is utterly ridiculous considering that the service that they provide is immediate.

there is no phone number for customer support anywhere on their site or anywhere online. 

i had an issue where my account was hacked and someone is running up hundreds of dollars on my account after attempting to reach out to them iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve heard nothing. 

this is after i attempted to contact the driver whole he was in route to deliver fraudulent order, only to have the system tell me the call cannot be completed repeatedly, and sending text messages i never got a response to.

this is after almost a year of not using the app because the last time i did, my food order was wrong and there was no way to contact the driver to get it fixed, leaving us with food that we couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt eat that was already charged to my credit card, after having waited almost an hour for my food.

if it was possible to give this app zero stars i would. i canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt recall ever having had a worse experience with a company in my life. i highly recommend not using this app and instead using uber eats which is far superior service and customer service wise.

edit / followup - almost a week and still no reply. even the nonsense reply to this to ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂcontact developerÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ option never appeared *surprise!*

fast forward 2 weeks. i decided to give them another chance. i ordered a medium pizza, a salad, calzone, and 12 wings. the salad did not come, i received 6 wings, and my order arrived 1.5 hours later than their right lateral limit on their estimated time window. the pizza food was cold. i had to put everything in the oven to heat it up. i once again complained and they offered me another 3% refund. instead of wasting another hour of my time for an additional 2%. i disputed the charge and won.

fast forward another month. a new restaurant opened near me that we wanted to try, and postmates was the only delivery option. so we decided to use them again. when we went to open the app, we were blocked. 

i wouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt even call their customer service poor, it is simply nonexistent. over the 6 times i used them, i probably received on average 60% of the food i paid for, with 1/3 of the 60% being incorrect, and 2/3 probability of that 60% being cold.

every other food delivery service, waiter, grubhub, doordash, grubhub, etc. are far superior. iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve used the other services 150-200 times and rarely if ever even have a minor issue. postmates is the worst. itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs a con of company, with zero accountability or ethics. if you want half your food, and you want it to be cold or incorrect, then postmates is the app for you. if you want great services, use anything else. itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs no wonder they are being bought at a discount by grubhub. complete garbage.",3/30/2020 23:19,postmates,apple,email,,,,0

1,two orders in the last two weeks have miraculously change my tip from 2 & 3 dollars to $30! itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs the same amount so i know itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs a glitch. i even triple checked last night before ordering and full total including tip was $32 then after the hour i get an email saying itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs been adjusted to $62. disgusting! stealing from customers around the holidays. why would i tip more than the meal itself? i will be disputing these charges and never using this fraudulent app again.,12/9/2020 12:17,ubereats,apple,email,,,,0
1,uber does not accept my debit card. i've added it and deleted it and tried again. it never works. it will also say it was unable to add my card and i try again and it says that's a card you already have. my husband even helped me email support and they said they fixed it and it still doesn't work. i would rather walk the three or four miles then use uber again.

1,update uber eats doesnt actyally fix problems. if you order and the item is missing they say too bad. if an item is wrong thwy say too bad. ordered food which was uppriced from actual price. i tried their monthly subscription. . . they add to the fees to take them off. the driver was sent to pick up a second order which made mine late and cold. sent a dozen emails and the end result wad basically . . . eh it shouldnt be cold. no refund credit or even sincere apology. dont order using these guys.,11/23/2020 17:55,ubereats,google,email,,,,0
1,"update: after many back and forth emails where they tried say everything was normal, they refunded the food but not the tip(iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm ok with this as the driver did bring the food). and the they admitted there was a known issue and ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂit was my fault for not refreshing the app after the error message.ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ yeah... my advice is to save the hassle and use a different service if possible. 

i used to love this app. it worked well and had a better interface than other apps iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂd used(doordash ad postmates). but that all changed when the app gave me an error when checking out. it failed to order, several times, giving me some ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂserver errorÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ message. then an order went through and i was happy... until i saw that one of the previous failed attempts was now active as well. so, then i had two orders. both already had drivers assigned and so couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt be canceled. i tried calling the restaurant, but they didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt have any orders from uber eats since the drivers themselves would be making the orders. i tried contacting the drivers and got nothing in return. so, i ended up with two orders than arrived within 30 minutes of each other. two bills. two tips. too piles of food. more than half of which was sushi... who the hells wants leftover sushi!!? 

and all the time this was happening, i was trying to get support from uber. there is no support from uber. they dontÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ care. seriously, after i got both ordered, i got an email confirming the whole thing was done, and a link for support. i wrote them an email about what happened begging for them to care, even just a little. nope. they responded with: can you tell use about what happened. so, i did, again. then they responded(the day after the events) with: ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂunfortunately, it has already started preparing your second order and weÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre unable to refund you even if you cancel.ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ

i repeat, their error caused the double order. and there was zero ways to stop it form continuing to go through. 

and at the end of their email, they thank me for being a gold member. 

and so, that is how my very last order with uber eats went.",12/12/2020 2:30,ubereats,apple,email,,,,0
1,"update: since ubereats refused to remedy this situation, i contacted my bank and they reversed the charge. now, one month later, ubereats is holding my account and payment information hostage and refusing to delete my account. they are trying to re-charge me for the order and will not delete my account until the ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂoutstanding balanceÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ is paid. what a nightmare.

i used ubereats for the first time last night and will never use it again. i ordered some food from a pizza joint 7 minutes away from my house at 8:30pm (after dinner rush). and deposit the estimate being 40min, it took more than 1h10m to get here. the food did not get picked up from the restaurant until 15min after the restaurantÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs posted closing time. it took the driver more than 20 minutes to get here from a restaurant 7 minutes away. upon arrival, sauce was spilled everywhere within the bags and everything was cold. not lukewarm, cold. we just moved and donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt have appliances yet, which is why we ordered food in the first place. we had no way of reheating the cold food; though not ubereats fault but we shouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt have to re-cook the food we ordered. i used the ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂget helpÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ button from the order page and was emailed back today. the customer service rep apologized but said there was nothing they could do about it. donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt waste your time or money with this app like i did please. try postmates or grubhub if theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre available in your area.",7/13/2018 0:11,ubereats,apple,email,,,,0

this is a poor excuse for business logistics and customer service.

1,i downloaded the app to get some taco bell (advertising on facebook and they said free delivery). had to call customer service because the app refused to honor what it offered as well for the free delivery offer. besides that they never had anyone coming to get the food. i had to call the store multiple times because i couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt actually edit the order like they act like you can (forgot to ask for hot sauce). i waited for almost an hour before calling grub hub again when i realized the order wasnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt getting picked up. after calling in the customer service rep wouldnt even admit if they have drivers out or not and obviously they didnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt as the time just keep getting longer and longer for a delivery. long story short i had to get up sick as hell to go grab some food out in the cold because they couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt be professional or honest to begin with. why even take the order if there is no one to deliver it?,1/20/2020 6:05,grubhub,apple,facebook,,,,0

of course the developer is a complete moron because it doesnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt just send a code or a password to your phone which would be easy, it says that it has sent a password reset to your email, but it never comes in.
i canÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt even create a new account because it says ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂthat phone number is already in useÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ. itÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs not like a username where that doesnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt matter, it has to be your phone number. i literally canÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt use the app because it wonÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt let me in to use it.

found out ten months after iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂd placed my last order that, four months earlier, theyÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂd gone ahead and signed me up for their dashpass program. thatÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs right: i hadnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt ordered anything for six months, but they just went ahead and signed me up for a recurring-charge ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂloyalty programÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ offering exciting discounts on select deliveries from valued partners. not only without my permission, but without even informing me. on a service i hadnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt used for six months. 

yeah, i finally got my money back. it only took sixty-odd tweets, some personally directed at the founders and ceos if the company, plus two facebook postings, a tumblr post, and a one-star yelp review of the last business iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂd ordered via doordash from. that is to say, if the money i got refunded were wages instead of a refund of money that theyÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂd (accidentally, they say) defrauded me out of, i would have been paid less than minimum wage for the writing. but of course, it wasnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt wages at all; it was a refund of the interest-free loan they'd helped themselves to from the credit card they had on file from the few times i tried their service. 

and man, they sure took their time giving me that refund of the loan they helped themselves to. in the meantime, i was getting chirpy pr verbiage about how sorry they were that dashpass ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂdidnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt meet my needs.ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ uh, yeah, great job reframing the problem as one of customer dissatisfaction. as if my desire to actually approve charges being assessed on my credit card were just one of a number of equally valid consumer choices, instead of being fraudulent and a violation of their usage agreement with the visa corporation.

i immediately reach out to uber who takes their sweet time getting back to me, so much so that my bank (shoutout to usaa) took care of it before they ever even replied. the charges were dropped and my card was replaced due to some other attempted fraudulent charges. 
i thought that was end of it, fast forward to june 17th, 2021. iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂm super sick, trying to get some soup or something delivered so i download postmates and log in (because again i donÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt use these services anymore) and what do i see? my account is frozen because uber is demanding i pay them that fraudulent charge.
uber was aware from february that it was fraudulent because i did eventually get in contact with someone but they never did anything about it 
i reach out via facebook messenger because there is no support help in app. you canÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt talk to anyone. literally the only option is to pay them $10 i donÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt owe them (yes uber is doing the most over $10 like they arenÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt a billion dollar company)

i send an email basically just repeating myself yet again because uber canÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt be bothered to read (couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt even get what platform i reached out on right, i donÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt use twitter)
i get an email back the next day (yeah somehow it takes 24 hours to send an email for a problem they created in the first place)  basically saying my account is on hold because my bank disputed the $10 charge and if i pay it i can use my account 
i email back saying no and informing them i will be opening a report with the bbb. iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂm refusing to repeat myself to uber anymore because theyÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂre clearly not even reading the messages i send, otherwise they would have known i am very aware what my bank did since iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂm the one who contacted them to do it.

i spent a long time trying to find some way to contact or call someone.  thereÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs no chat option either, so basically, thereÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs no way to get immediate help when the delivery guy messes up.  the app wouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt even let me go to the menu until i tipped the delivery guy (btw, thereÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs literally no option for me to refuse to tip an incompetent delivery guy).  donÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt bother trying on your computer, too, because itÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs the same when it comes to getting help.  btw, why do you guys have a phone number if it doesnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt take incoming calls?  

when i explained on the app what happened, i only got postmates credit back rather than a straight refund to my card.  btw, i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt even get a full refund on my postmates.  i got $41/$55 of my money to my account rather than my full money, which shouldÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂve gone back to my debit card.

i had no choice but to try to reach out through their facebook.  idk of the social media site is run by 1-2 people or something, but it took over 40 minutes just to get something done.  rather than refunding all my money back to my debit card, all they did was increase my postmates credit to $55 rather than just simply returning my money to my card.  i asked them for a receipt of the refund and i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt get anything.

people, stick to ubereats or doordash or just get the food yourself or get a friend or family member to get it for you.  avoid postmates at all costs.

postmates, unless you plan to return all my money to my original form of payment (my debit card), donÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt even bother responding to my review here.  absolutely worst service and experience iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂve ever had in a while.  i hope your service gets shut down one day.  no wonder my friends avoid you guys.",7/17/2020 3:34,postmates,apple,facebook,,,,0

that should have been where i learned my lesson right? wrong. i decided to give the app another chance because how could they mess up again? well, tonight i placed an order while i was at work so it would arrive shortly after i got back to my apartment. you can probably guess that didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt happen. i arrived at my apartment expecting to have my food soon, but i actually saw the driver drive right past my building on the app. the driver then continued to drive about 15 minutes in the wrong direction. i sent the driver a message because i thought that the gps on the app must have been malfunctioning. but sure enough, after i sent that message the driver called me and said he had arrived. i confirmed my address with him and there was mass confusion. he tried to say that the address was not right and that i had to meet him at the address i had ordered the food to. i triple checked my delivery address and it was definitely correct. the driver admitted that he messed up and would come to my location asap. i received my food 20 minutes later. and you can probably guess that it was cold. the best part is that the place i ordered food from is a 10 minute walk or 3 minute drive from my apartment. the only reason i ordered instead of walking was because itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs freezing cold outside. next time, iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll put a coat on and walk.",1/28/2019 4:17,doordash,apple,gps, location,,,0

1,i really hate this app. i travel back and forth from college and home and it cannot adapt to the location changes. it keeps telling that they don't deliver that far even when changed my home address. i also let them use the current location gps thing and that does not either,1/21/2019 1:24,grubhub,google,gps, location,,,0
1,i used gps to set my location they sent the driver 2 towns away. the driver then called me up screaming... they canceled my order after i waited an hour. i couldn't even give the driver a bad rating because they canceled it so it just doesn't allow you to review. they can have a negative review here instead. if you think about it the rude driver who yelled at me for grubhub's mistake ended up with my $30 taco dinner for free i also tipped in advance go figure,6/18/2021 16:03,grubhub,google,gps, location,,,0
2,"iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve been using this app for over a year. the variety of restaurants and ability to track orders over gps were the main advantages, in my view. currently, iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂd give them kudos for tech support which, despite likely being some combination of bots and real people, is pretty fast and effective. 

i have had frustrations around what i (and other users i spoke with) perceived to be hidden fees. there used to be a service fee for ordering that was a percentage of the overall order. it was annoying because it wouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt be reflected in the cost until the very final page on which the order is placed. i think that the fee might still apply, but through some combination of my becoming more aware of its implications and avoiding large orders to minimize the absolute fee, i got over it. 

what i canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt get over is what has happened over the past several weeks. i have seen firsthand half a dozen instances in which an order was aborted in a way that showed complete disregard for customersÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ time. in two cases, the order was cancelled without notificationÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂand in one of these cases it happened 90 minutes after the order had been placed. why? the restaurant was out of business. putting aside the issue of allowing orders to be placed to a defunct business, what does it say about doordash that they werenÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt aware of the situation (or couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt be bothered to tell me) until after the food supposedly should have been delivered??). 

in the other two cases, the order was marked as complete about 40 minutes after ordering and i was charged, but the food was never picked up or delivered. it was only upon checking for the driverÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs location that i saw that something wasnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt right. i then had to go through support to seek a refund (which, fast as they are, wasted even more time). 

bottom line is buyer beware. the app charges a premium but i suspect that rather than being applied to enhance service or software, itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs used to placate customer complaints that result from major problems in doordashÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs systems. i might try them again in a year, but with all of the other options now available that werenÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt when they started, why bother...?",8/12/2018 22:50,doordash,apple,gps, location,,,0

1,"i am a very regular user of ubereats. the app has deteriorated on several front. 

first, the app itself...the tracking feature is horrible and needs to be fixed. it frequently shows drivers stationary for 10 minutes at a time and then jumps to where they really are. drivers frequently appear to make u-turns even though there is no realistic way they could have. also on this app and the regular uber app, the gps instructions drivers typically get are horrible and in no way reflect the most direct or fastest route. 

there is also no real way to handle a dispute. ubereats frequently just says sorry when food arrives outside delivery window, is wrong, or my personal favorite when drivers stop and do errands on the way and food is delivered cold. 

if some of these things donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt get fixed, iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm likely going to switch to postmates or door dash.",11/26/2018 23:26,ubereats,apple,gps,,,,0

1,i place clear instructions for my order the restaurants never receive and then i get the wrong food. what's the point of having a comments section if it never gets relayed?? and the drivers constantly complain about the bad gps in their app. why do i need to go flag them down?? ridiculous,1/19/2020 11:24,ubereats,google,gps,,,,0
1,i placed an order only to watch as the dasher circled around past my house and headed back to the restaurant. i texted the dasher and they said that the apps gps was messed up. i asked them to go back and have the restaurant remake the order since it would be cold by the time they got back to my house. i ended up getting called my a customer service rep that couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt speak english who eventually hung up on me when i said that i wanted my order re-delivered and my order refunded due to the inconvenience. i tried to call the number back but it wouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt let me talk to anyone. i ended up contacting doordash through their chat support and they decided to talk down to me and lie instead of helping me at all. the customer service team is complete garbage,7/27/2019 20:57,doordash,apple,gps,,,,0
1,"i placed an order that had a wait time of about 45 minutes. i noticed some other, similar restaurants had similar wait times and it was dinner time so i was prepared to wait. the eta kept creeping up until it hit the max eta when it suddenly cancelled. then i was informed that the restaurant had cancelled my order 15 minutes after receiving it because they were overwhelmed (my husband drove by on the way home from work that night and saw they had a sign up saying they were understaffed and not all services were available). but it was 15 minutes after receiving my order that they cancelled it yet uber eats only cancelled my order because the timer ran out 1 1/2 hours later. 

when i contacted support it took two days for them to respond. they said that ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂsometimes things happen that are beyond the control of either the restaurant or uberÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ, that there had been an ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂoutageÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ and that since they hadnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt charged me there was no issue. except for the issue that my kids had to wait over 2 hours for their food because i had no car and hadnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt gotten to go to the grocery yet. thankfully doordash came through. they cost a little more but are more reliable. this was my first and only time using uber eats. i will never do business with them again.

uber eats
pros:
 slightly cheaper delivery fee, 
more options with tip amount

cons:
app shuts down when restaurants are closed (you cannot access anything, not account, support, nothing you must go to the web page),
support takes forever to respond and does so with a dismissive attitude spouting the itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs not our fault or the restaurant company line, 
app offers limited information on delivery and has a very wide window of eta before you are allowed to make any inquiries.

doordash
pros:
app allows you to see and alter your account details at any time, 
you are allowed to make inquiries with doordash and the restaurant concerning your order at any time, 
you get a clear image on an updating gps map of where your dasher is, 
you are given your dasherÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs name and contact info in case you need to reach them (helpful when i noticed one had circled my block twice so i called her and told her how to find us), 
if there is a problem with the order doordash immediately responds and begins steps to investigate and resolve said issues which can be anything from missing items to dasher took too long and food was cold (iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve only had that happen once)

cons:
slightly higher delivery fee, 
dashers can take on multiple orders which can delay your order arrival, 
less tip control than uber eats but only because they donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt allow you to put in a % you have to choose

overall iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm going back to doordash. i was really hoping it would work out, there are food options on uber that are not on doordash in my area but this just turned me off of the whole thing. especially their customer support. 2 days to say not our fault? they should have said ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂweÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre sorry, sometimes these things happen. please give us another chance.ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ instead i get ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂit was an outageÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ when i know very well it was because the restaurant couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt handle the order volume due to short-staffing which is unfortunate but what can you do? iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm not interested in dealing with a company that makes excuses and lies. no thank you.",3/30/2021 23:09,ubereats,apple,gps,,,,0
1,"i reached out to cancel my order (before it arrived) because i had a driver who was driving in all sorts of directions and then stopping at random spots for minutes at a time. i got beyond frustrated watching this man on the gps for almost an hour since he picked up my food from the restaurant that was only about a 6 minute drive from my house. my food arrived cold, and top of that my drink was missing and i also received a wrong item. so technically two items i ordered, i did not receive. the uber tech did acknowledge that my food arrived substantially late but only apologized. i submitted picture proof of my order showing i received incorrect items. the person sent me automated messages saying ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂim sorry for that service, its not ubers standardsÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ.  but thats all. just generated messages. no offer of a refund or partial credit for atleast the missing items. i asked to speak to someone else over the chat and was simply sent another automated message saying thanks for contacting us, i have given you all the info you need and then disconnected from the chat. so if this is the service we as customers get, then why are we being charged service & delivery fees on top of the food plus tip? i the only way i received any sort of help was by tapping various help sections in the app, until finally thru the app i got a refund for the missing item. which i should've been given automatically from their help. uber makes it impossible to find help or contact anyone, then they will ignore you, take your money, hit you with various fees when you try to cancel an order etc.",5/17/2020 16:23,ubereats,apple,gps,,,,0
1,"i stopped using doordash because the service became worse and worse. viewing the gps through the app, we would watch the delivery driver make other pickups and deliveries after they picked up our food. after a cold meal was delivered almost an hour late, with the driver lying about making other deliveries after getting our food (we watched their travels with the app), we stopped using them. about 10 months later, we tried again. same thing. never again.",5/25/2019 13:36,doordash,google,gps,,,,0

2,"i use doordash quite a bit and never had problems until today. the driver drove to the restaurant and drove back to her original spot. after an hour of waiting i texted her and asked her where my food was after watching her drive out of her way back to her original spot past my house. she told me her app crashed and if i call doordash i could fix it faster. unprofessional in my opinion. not only that but every phone has gps and she couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt used her to come here without the app. she also never let us know why it was taking so long, which it never had before. i told her to cancel my order because after over an hour of sitting on a box i donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt want to eat it. i had to cancel it and ask a refund myself. not sure if i want to keep ordering if the people canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt do their job or be more helpful. i like the convenience but not if the drivers canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt do their job efficiently.",4/23/2020 22:17,doordash,apple,gps,,,,0

1,"iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve been using uber eats for a couple of years now and order at least 3 times a week.  or did, anyway.  now iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm down to maybe once a week and even then it has to be a cheap place.  my friend used to order for he and his wife and 4 kids regularly but with the new pricing structure, itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs out of control expensive so they have completely stopped.  i know several people who simply wonÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt uber eats anymore.  iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm close.  it was going to cost me $14 to order $12 worth of food the other day.  thatÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs ridiculous and iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm not doing it anymore.  so now, i only order when itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs just me and then somewhere very cheap.  i know what uber is doing, they are trying to shift the revenue from the restaurants to uber by making the percentage cost so high that unless a restaurant offers .99 cent delivery, nobody will order.  which shifts the majority of the profit to uber since most people will only spend a certain amount on delivery.  before, a significant portion of that went to the restaurants.  ultimately it hurts the consumer though and will result in less of a selection of restaurants to choose from.  i know multiple restaurants that are stopping uber eats delivery because of it.  
on top of that, the app gps apparently is terrible.  i have lived 3 places in the last 2 years and in each case, uber took them to the wrong place at least half of the time. the drivers said this is very common.  
i have found that it is cheaper to have groceries delivered via any of the available grocery delivery services so i will just be doing that from now on.  
uber needs to be sent a message and i suspect within 6 months, they will.  i donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt know a single person as willing as i am to pay for convenience but iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm done with uber eats.  paying more for delivery than the actual food is idiotic.  hopefully grub hub and / or door dash will step up and take that business from them until they learn.

update:   stop posting the pre-canned responses to reviews.  itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs insulting.  and they make no sense.  just fix the problems.",5/4/2019 19:03,ubereats,apple,gps,,,,0

not only did a driver hit on me once- as i politely refused him several times. my food was always cold and took forever to get to me. 
the straw that broke the camels back was my food was 2.5 hours late and the gps showed him across town heading away from my house. and when i called the service line they told me they couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt contact the driver!!! and he was very rude about it. i had to argue with him to get a refund for food i never got.

1,"if you are considering going with uber eats for your restaurant, you should know that their customer service is absolutely useless.  

we have been with them about a year now. donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt worry, iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm going to give you many examples:

-uber bicycle:  order placed at approximately 1530 hrs. on 04.13.2019. bicycle driver picked up but unable to deliver due to flat tire. i only know this because the cyclist called the store.  somehow, uber managed to delete the order completely instead of canceling it. because the order had been deleted they had no record of it and were talking to me as if i was crazy. after several conversations with different people, i think we were finally paid for the order, maybe. if i had not been paying attention, we would not have been paid for the order at all and received no notification from uber at all.  this has us most concerned about the integrity of process, if it can be deleted instead of canceling. and also there was no way to contact the customer because they had deleted the order.

-also if you press them too hard, they will just cancel the order. i have been on a three-way call with uber and the customer. the customer service representative from uber is saying ok, we will call the customer and see what they want to do. the customer told me that they still want the order. however uber every time will tell me that they want to cancel the order and they will just cancel it even though the customer is on the phone with me saying that they want the order. this has happened at least five times, usually because a driver has been dispatched but they never show up. so 30 or 45 minutes goes by and iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm asking uber if they can just dispatch a new driver. they cannot. they are unable to, so their solution is just to cancel the order.  a couple of times iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve actually resorted to delivering the order myself because they screwed up so badly.

-order for shahroze: this order was picked up before we closed. the screen says customer canceled. when i called uber, the representative said that the driver canceled the order due to the restaurant being closed. this order was picked up. at first it said we got paid zero. i actually had to talk to somebody to get paid and then they still want to take commission. even though the driver picked up the order and it says order complete they were actually going to not pay us for the order. 

-several orders: several times the driver has picked up from the wrong restaurant. there is a note on uber for drivers that says specifically where we are located.  often times i will find that a driver has waited for 15 minutes at the wrong restaurant. the last time this happened (yesterday), i called the driver and i told them that they were at the wrong restaurant. i said iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll see you soon right? and they said yes. five minutes later i left my restaurant and walked down to where the gps said that they were. i called her name and she did not answer. then i said listen, is anybody here from uber? she said yes. i said is your name ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ? she said yes. i said ok this is the order you were supposed to pick up. you were sitting at the wrong restaurant. i still donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt think she understood what happened. make sure you call the customer soon as you realize this is going on. because iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm assuming that the driver is probably telling them that thereÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs a delay on your end, even when the food is sitting on your counter while they are waiting at the wrong place because they are not paying attention.

-order 968c6 brad: sometimes they have a system wide error of catastrophic proportions.  such as was the case with this order. was on hold for 25 minutes to understand what was going on and was hung up on. ended up staying an hour after we closed to try to take care of the customer. when i finally got through they told me they were locked out and could not even give me the customer phone number. so i was unable to communicate with the customer what was going on. maybe we lost this customer, i donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt know.  be sure to hand write customer phone number and code as soon as you get the order if you want to be able to communicate something with them. we have also had drivers pick up from the wrong restaurant and we cannot communicate with the customer about whatÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs going on because when they marked picked up, their contact information disappears.

-2 large glitches in their system that have not been fixed. these are clearly system errors. the first is that we keep getting random calls at different times almost every day from an automated message through ubereats. the message says that it is elise calling from uber eats and that they are calling to let us know that the system is off-line. i have called about this 5 to 10 times and every time the representative assured me that the system is online and that there has been no interruption. the first couple of times i called the representative was aware of this system error and said that we can ignore the message. but it still has not been fixed, after four or five months. the second glitch.  do not choose option notify customer that you are out of item. it will lock you out of the order, give the customer 10 minutes to respond, and then it will cancel the order. i stayed on the phone with a customer while this was happening and they never received a prompt to answer. 

-when i called about these glitches, i was never transferred to technical support. even though these are obvious software issues, they want to replace the tablet. they then proceeded to tell me it would take a couple days to get the new tablet and that meanwhile our uber service would be offline. i told them no thank you and hung up. they want me to lose money because their only solution is to replace the hardware when the issue is clearly with the software.

 -if you run into any delays or you accidentally hit ready, do not bother to call them. they canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt do anything about it.

-there is character limit for reviews, so i canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt list the other issues...",8/8/2019 18:08,ubereats,apple,gps,,,,0

1,in my area uber eats is a complete disaster. i deleted it today and i now stick to my trusty friend door dash which has pretty much the same options and more. my address is never computed into the gps properly for uber eats and when your driver doesnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt comprehend english it makes it a lot harder to text them or communicate directions with them. uber eats wonÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt issue you a refund even if youÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve waited 30 minutes plus. customer service wasnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt much help either and he said that he couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt do anything for me. i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt get my items and my order was canceled. i would reconsider the app if the gps for uber actually worked in my area.,9/7/2019 18:44,ubereats,apple,gps,,,,0
1,"in short, unless you order from somewhere a block from your house, the food will most likely be late, cold and inedible. great concept just like all the other services (uber eats, grubhub, caviar, etc...) but none of them get your food to you quickly, or warm, or sometimes even at all. i've tried this now almost a dozen times and with 2 exceptions, it's been horrible. the gps will tell you the driver is at your door, when they're on the other side of the city. good times.",10/20/2019 2:12,doordash,google,gps,,,,0

edit- i tried using support as recommended with no luck as the menu only allows drop down selection of which nothing is relevant. no resources to get support via phone which would make this process simpler.",7/21/2018 1:42,doordash,apple,gps,,,,0

1,"my experience with uber eats was a mess. i ordered, waited an unusually long time, and was in the end scammed. the driver did not drop off food, sent a blank photo of the order, and hung up on me when i called. trying to find how to get support for the issue with uber was obtuse, and in the end there was no readily apparent method to contact someone even by phone number since my calls never went through. at least i was able to click the button that gave me a refund, but i feel pretty marooned by uber. and how do they address issues like this if they donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt get reports from customers? iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm just perplexed and vexed by the entire situation. i will not be using uber in the future and recommend doordash, since iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve had better experiences and way shorter wait times.

(face palm). so i ended up getting a carmel coffe thing. then the guy goes to deliver it and uber gps sent him to the completely wrong place even tho i typed in the correct address. so i called him, he was nice and polite and he eventually came to me, i had to meet him at my apartment complex office becuase the gps is useless. i cant use normal uber becuase of this gps problem i use lyft. i have to call the uber driver and give a small speech everytime becuase their gps is useless. this wasnt simple like i thought it would be, and like it says it will be. if they dont have something then take it off the menu.",10/12/2017 13:31,ubereats,google,gps,,,,0
2,"this app is very bare bones and has many areas where it is in extreme dire need of improvement. first of all the app should let the user be the one to set the address will be delivered, instead of relying on gps and autocorrecting the address that the user enters based on said gps. because i've gps will always be wrong. and the user is left to find a way to contact the vendor or driver to correct an error that came about through the sheer dumb design choices. while we're in that note uber would also do well to allow the user to contact the vendor for to correct the error as early as possible.",9/22/2018 17:51,ubereats,google,gps,,,,0

i tried postmates a couple years ago and had a bad experience, so i held a grudge for awhile. after moving and hearing so many positive reviews i thought i would give it another try.
i work a 12 hour night shift (6pm-6am) and canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt leave the building during my shift, so if i donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt bring my lunch i have few options around the time i take my lunch break. 
since iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve used post mates, iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve had my order cancelled from 3 restaurants in a row, waiting until 5-10 minutes before arrival (on a 45-55 minute total order time) to cancel my order and have me start again. i understand restaurants might not be open due to the covid-19 crisis, but waiting until the order should be arriving is grossly unprofessional on postmates part.
iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve currently been waiting for my chipotle order for over an hour, and there have been 3 different drivers since i placed the order, and 10 minutes before the order was supposed to arrive, the driver was still sitting miles away. the app said the driver was ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂat chipotle mexican grill,ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ while vehicle gps was sitting by an apartment complex. then, the time for my order shifted to a later time, saying that the merchant wasnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt ready yet. i doubt it takes chipotle an hour to prepare a burrito bowl, chips, and guacamole. 
after the time shifted later, the driver changed again and hopefully i can get it before my conference call.

update: order arrived: chips, guacamole, and cold steak in a bowl. no rice, veggies, cheese, or salsa, which you manually have to add during the order process. the refund option also doesnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt refund the full amount, iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm assuming they keep the fees for their substandard services. i still tipped the driver that actually delivered my food because it transferred to him after i already should have gotten my order and he went straight through, but the app still shouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt mark him as ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂat chipotleÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ when he is in his driveway.",4/20/2020 0:27,postmates,apple,gps,,,,0

1,"was a bit disappointed that i have to give personal identification information (pii) before i'm even allowed to access the app or what it offers to my area. 

i also did not like how it asks for both an email and a phone number (to send your receipt) to. why not just one or the other? 

why do i need a receipt sent to both my email and my phone? why am i not offered an option to just select one or the other? what if i've given this app my number and email only to realize it's not available in my area? 

just suggestions? i would be more willing, i guess, to give away this information if i knew i had an option. if i was actually placing an order then yes, here's my phone number (just as if i was ordering from any other delivery spot) but i don't call them leave them my name and number and then say.... i don't want the food. 

i get convenience. i do. but i also value options before giving away my number, my email, or in this case... both. 

that's all. 

i'm sure it's a great app. just wish i would have been given a chance to see it and or check it out to see if it was something i would even be interested in.",6/30/2017 20:46,ubereats,apple,identification info,email,,,1

applied, gave my ssn, identification info, did a background check, so on and so forth. got my gear within 2 days, which was cool. they even sent a very misleading email stating ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂitÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs official, youÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre now apart of postmates fleet. blah, blah, blah. so after i obviously thought i was basically approved, and maybe just waiting for a final approval of my account to activate it. i waited about 3 weeks for any further info (says it only takes max 7 days) only then to receive an email stating i was rejected. i was given no reason, no contact info, no email to contact, only the ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂcheckrÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ site to check the status of my background check (which had been completed 2 weeks earlier). i have sent out 3 or 4 emails pleading to get a response backÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ with absolutely no luck. i was spammed with 10-15 general info & useless postmates emails trying to give me hook-ups and deals. only emails i got in my waiting time. i am going to make sure none of my friends & close associates buy and/or deal with postmates. i will make it a point to make sure everyone knows the truth about this disappointing, misleading, and over-promising company. iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm definitely going to push for answers or some type of closure from postmates until i get a solid answer. this company will not last much longer with these pathetic standards. iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm 100% sure.

($$4-5) per delivery is cutting it pretty close to how many miles you end up driving at the end of the delivery. take in mind you might have to drive back quite a long distance to your home city).

what really doesnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt sit well with me is, not even knowing all that prior info would be required, i had bought a gift card, so as to protect myself, for personal safety reasons as well as financial safety. i entered the gift card and had a zero balance due. doordash, even though i still have funds available on the gift card, then requires a credit card. . . the info i had deliberately bought their gift card to avoid having to share. 
their next move is one that is ultimately cringeworthy. for me to be able to place my order i am first required to pay for my items but also tip the driver before receiving anything. this is troubling. . . i have no way of knowing how to tip someoneÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs performance before they have carried out the act that i am making that decision based on. not only that, this driver can then decide if they are happy with their tip or not and handle my order as they see fit. that destroys the whole purpose of a tip from top to bottom. 
maybe i am missing something here, which quite frankly i can only hope is the case, but this is really not how i feel business is conducted and will not have me back anytime soon.",4/29/2020 16:35,doordash,apple,last name,credit card,location,,1

this morning i come to find out that yesterday, 12/29 not only did i get charged for the food that never came but a yearly subscription to postmates that i never authorized to be charged! wouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt anyone be upset about this?!

all i have gain from your services is a major headache and $168.40 taken from not only one credit card but in two separate credit cards i had listed on the postmate app. please tell me that is not bizarre?! 

all i ask is for my money to be returned/ reversed at once. i have been patient with receiving a response to my issue due to the holidays but iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm running out of them being that all that is happening from your end is nothing but just keep charging for things i never got or never authorized.",12/30/2018 13:40,postmates,apple,location,credit card,email,,0

while the service can be convenient, the app is misleading on orders. on multiple occasions, the app claimed that there was a delay at the merchant. i called merchants on severe occasions and they shared that no driver had come to pick up the order.

1,"it is worth noting that i used to never have issues ordering on grubhub until recently so take this as you will.

my last five consecutive orders had issues which have caused me to evaluate how i engage in food delivery service. while grubhub may have invented online convenience ordering at some of your favorite locations, theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve done little by way of refining their dated business model.

specifically, one has to wonder why they havenÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt implemented some form of gps tracking for customer peace of mind. iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve now had three orders canceled due to driver unavailability (which isnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt even known until you make the call stating your food is late), and on one occasion, i picked up my own food and was given a measly delivery fee waiver as compensation.

the company is stingy with its compensation in general when the mistakes and issues that occur are easily avoidable but never addressed by a business that, by all accounts, seems to have grown too large to remain cognizant of the details that drive their customers away.

if things donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt change with the company and business model to favor consumers which produce their revenue, itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs safe to say that this will be my last time using the service.

2,"03/11/2020 update to your reply:
thank you for your reply.
the issue  may be that your app is reading my location too late in the ordering process.
if you can look into your code and try to have the location filtered first to show the restaurants that will deliver to my address, this issue will probably be resolved.

when opening app, my address is at the top, so it seems logical to only show places that will deliver to my location.
itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs a waste of space and time to show a bunch of places that will not deliver to me.
if your code can read my address first, this may be eliminated.

disappointing to pick a place, fill your cart, go to checkout then find out the place wonÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt deliver to you.
is there a way to update the app so it doesnt allow us to put items into cart when we cant get delivery from that establishment?
otherwise, could be a great app. for places that deliver to me, itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs been a pleasant experience.
it would definitely be an improvement if uber eats could let me know before i place an order that i canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt get delivery. why make me go thru process of ordering the food if iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂm not going to be getting the food?",4/11/2020 13:31,ubereats,apple,location,,,,0

1,"i apologize for the length of this post, but my last experience with this company was so awful, i feel detail is necessary. 

i used this app while at work, but for some reason our street address is not recognized. the first statement in my address description is ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂgoogle does not recognize our address,ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ and then i give more details, such as the street corner we are on, that we are located on the college campus in town, a link to a campus map, a description of landmarks on our street, a description of the building, and when i have time, iÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll type in directions from the restaurant to my office. i used the app more than 20 times even though many of my orders were late on several occasions- enough so that my coworkers made fun of me for still using it.

i have made two complaints. the first time, my order was an hour late. i sent in a delivery issue message through the app, they responded quickly and gave me a full refund. i was very happy with that outcome, so i continued using the app.  

the second time i reported, i included directions from the restaurant to our building, but my food was again ridiculously late (roughly an hour and a half). when the driver called me to get help finding us (and it was already very late at that point), they had their mother on their car speakers trying to help, which was extremely confusing because i was not sure when i was being spoken to. the driver then chose to yell at me when i did not immediately respond to a question directed to me. i informed the driver several times that i was unsure as to when i was being spoken to, but that was ignored. additionally, the driver argued with me about the location and loudly sighed and huffed during the entire 10 minute phone call. our campus is literally designed in a square that measures one mile around, total, so we are not a big place whatsoever, and my office sits on one of the corners! the driver never grasped the concept. i had a coworker try to help me after the driver continued to struggle to find us. 

when the driver did arrive, something in the bag had leaked, they did not bring the $3.95 drink i ordered and asked if i was sure i ordered it when i asked about it. they then blamed the restaurant and made no offer to go back and get the drink. i sent in a message through the app and was told my account had been flagged and my message would need reviewing, which sounds a lot like, ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂyouÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve complained too much, so weÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre flagging you as a problem.ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ it has been over two months and i have not received any communication from them, which i think is just more evidence that there is no intention to make this right. i paid $22.59 for that horrible experience! 

just use other apps or go get it yourself. it may cost more, but at least youÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂll get to eat during your lunch break and no one will yell at you because they cannot follow directions.",11/4/2019 18:35,doordash,apple,location,,,,0

1,i downloaded this app while on vacation in or. we ordered pizza to be delivered to our hotel. easy right? no. not at all. the app makes you use your location to ensure acurate location however when placing my order the app set my location 500ft away in a vacant lot. upon realizing this i tried fervently to contact the dasher to no avail. no response no answer. before i knew it the order was marked as delivered. delivered where?! i called customer service but was told it was my fault :( no refund,1/3/2020 21:18,doordash,google,location,,,,0

1,"i just want to make it clear first that i never i mean never leave reviews on the internet because i am 22 years old and my generation typically doesn't do that. but when i say don't use grubhub in orlando, please take my word for it. absolutely horrible. i've been here on vacation for three days and have ordered food delivered to my hotel the past two nights. last night i waited three hours for 10 pieces of sushi and called the restaurant to see what was going on and the lady said that this always happens with grubhub and that the driver just never showed up. she gave me grubhub's number and i gave them a call and the lady on the phone sounded appalled that i waited that long and very generously gave me a $10 coupon as well as a refund. i decided to try again tonight with a different location and the same thing happened again. i waited for three hours for a pizza delivery that i was looking forward to and it never showed up. the restaurant closed and i couldn't even call. i called grubhub very upset and i received a refund again as well as $10 coupon again. i appreciate the kindness of the customer service people i spoke with but this is ridiculous. in a tourist filled city like orlando having drivers available should not be an issue and if it is, customers should be made aware immediately so that way they can make other plans before it's too late. i am now starving and nothing is open.",9/3/2018 1:11,grubhub,google,location,,,,0

last week, i made an order and saw a postmate that checked in as waiting for the order at the restaurant. a few minutes after, another postmate appeared on the application as heading to the restaurant. later, the second postmate texted me and asked i i received the order. i have not. he informed me that he is being told by the restaurant staff that the order was picked up earlier and that there is nothing he can do. pistmates issued me a refund and believe that it is the least they could do in this instance.

today, i placed the order again. postmate picked up the order and drove to my location. i saw her on the map located in the parking lot of my apartment complex. however, she never delivered the order, she never knocked on the door and never called. the order was marked as delivered. i reported this issue to postmates; however, they told me that they arenÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt able to issue a credit or a refund at this time. i asked what the reason was for that to which they said that i had an issue missing a postmate in the past and told me to check my address. my address was correct. still they told me they were not going to do anything for me.

after writing this i found out they did it to another one of my orders from the same day. it was from subway (1 sub thatÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs it, no chips nor drink) which was $18 and something cents. final sale. then i left a $2.81 tip that was charged separately. from my account i see i was charged $21.55 (again for one sandwich!!!!!!) and then the additional $2.81. i honestly cannot believe this. they changed the total two days later for both orders. these totals were with the service fee and delivery fee (i bought one of them for a friend and he paid me back so i knew the exact total, and then the sub was so outrageously priced i knew what it was too) honestly theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂre just stealing from me at this point. i thought $18 was bad for one sub. but then it changes to $21.55 + the $2.81 tip????????? never using this app again.

1,"we have had two really bad experiences with this company and it's drivers. they allow their drivers to accept multiple deliveries even if your order is running late. the last incident was so incredibly outrageous and we feel conned. we order a $60+ dinner and not only did it arrive a half hour late, it arrived cold and smelling of cigarettes. the pizza crust even tasted like cigarette smoke. we noticed that the driver (they have a tracking feature) went to three locations prior to ours and only one was official (via the tracker). we received our food a total of an hour after it was picked up. when i connected with the customer service ""chat"" agent, after about 15 minutes of ""chatting"" they first offered a $20 credit and then i said the food is essentially inedible, they upped it to $38 credit saying that it was the max they were allowed to offer. they should have refunded my meal and said that they will ensure this won't happen again, but instead they chose to have an angry customer for life in sf who will only share this story everywhere. please note that this is the third incident just like this with this company, so please know i was patient. don't use this company. stick with the other more established and reliable options where they don't allow their drivers to take on many deliveries before you get your food after paying huge fees. you will get better service from dominos.
update: i just used my $38 credit today and i wish i could show you the screenshot of my tracker. the driver accepted four other deliveries before ours and picked up our food 20 mins ago and is just getting to their first stop. food will be cold. nail in coffin. do not use this app. the 5 star reviews have to likely be fake reviews.",9/2/2017 20:51,doordash,apple,location,,,,0

that you have sought permission from these restaurants to post the data.  hopefully your strategy wins business for the black community and doesnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt harm it. also, in the spirit of being anti-discriminatory, you should consider offering the same benefits to asian and latino owned restaurants so as not to give the benefits to one race - lest you fall victim of hypocritically contradicting your anti-discrimination policy. i canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt give any more stars until i know the above has been satisfied. stay strong, uber! respect!",6/5/2020 4:58,ubereats,apple,permission,,,,0

a hold was placed on my account to a disputed payment, what do i do?
when postmates receives word of a payment dispute (or ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂchargebackÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ) from your bank, we assume the payment was made without your permission and immediately place a hold on your account to prevent any additional unauthorized transactions.

they have added non-partnered restaurants to their selection (makes up almost half of their restaurant base) & these restaurants:

so either a restaurant pays to be partnered (gh takes 20% of every order) or they are added without permission which can end up damaging their reputation.

1,"this is the first time i am posting a negative review but at this point i really am not sure what else to do. 

theyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂve messed up my orders before. but whateverÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ mess ups happen, items are out of stock. i am a reasonable person and i get how that can happen. however, at this point, it has happened frequently enough while using this app that ordering with postmates feels like i am gambling with my money. i may get my order, or i might not. 

a potential reason errors like this happen so frequently is because the system that postmates has set up is inadequate at best. i am never contacted if an item is out of stock or swapped out for something else that i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt even want. on top of it i am charged the full amount regardless of the incorrect order. other delivery apps allow drivers to contact you and ask for permission for substitution and automatically adjust the amount being charged to you but i guess postmates canÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt figure that out. 

so yeah, they messed up my most recent order (3 out of 5 items were wrong and missing), i got an in-app credit worth 9 bucks. this credit doesnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt cover for the incorrect/missing items (taxes and fees etc. included) and it can only be used if i order from postmates again. hereÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs the thing- i donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt want to gamble on postmates again.

when i brought this up to their customer service, i never got a response back. i sent in a charitable second reminder, and still never heard back from them. at this point- postmates has trapped me in a system of incompetency.   

to anyone out there, i would like to urge you to explore other delivery options. postmates still has a lot to figure out.",1/18/2021 21:40,postmates,apple,permission,,,,0

1,"to start, there are problems with the app not notifying you when orders come in. second, the app tracks your gps location everywhere in the background, even when the app is not on. i presume they are probably making money from this data like selling your info to the police departments during blm protests or any other protests to identify protesters. if you are a driver for another company they are more than likely using your data to track their competitors flow of business and customer base by recording your gps movements. i realized this was a possibility earlier on and limited grubhubÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs access to my gps location to only allowing full access when i was using the app, preventing any possible unethical gathering of my information and their competitors customer base information, which they could use in various ways, including targeted marketing. the app wonÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt even work without giving full ÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂalways on precise location accessÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ to run in the background forcing me to toggle on and off permissions just to run the app, which is a big red flag. my recommendation is to delete the grubhub app asap. also, if you are deciding on becoming a driver for grubhub, i would rethink that decision. a few weeks ago my account was suspended for no reason. for weeks i did not receive any detailed response to my emails asking an explanation for the temporary suspension. just a link to a form to contact their driver care specialist. after several times trying to get an answer by phone and by email, i was finally able to get a response by phone through grubhub customer support where i inquired about the suspension. i was told that there was a fraud note listed on my account, and that a diner/customer reported that they didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt receive their food. i have delivered thousands of orders with other companies with no problems and i have a positive rating of 100% delivery with those other competitors. i wouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt risk losing my account for a simple food order. they said they would investigate and everything should be fine. well weeks later they said they reactivated my account in which they stated in an email i received from pedro m.;

thank you for reaching out. 

we paused your account for a short period of time. we appreciate your patience. 

we have reactivated your account.

please be aware that if this activity continues, it may affect your ability to continue to partner with us.

yet my account is still not activated and i still did nothing wrong to deserve any of this. so, in dealing with grubhub it is just not worth going through the stress of being falsely accused of doing something wrong. my recommendation is to stick with driving for another company and stay far away from grubhub. i am so glad i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt sacrifice too much time and potentially mess up my working relationship with their competitors, just for grubhub. it is best just to delete the app asap to safeguard your privacy, and save yourself time and the headache of dealing with them, as their driver specialists are obviously not trained enough to realize their unethical practices when dealing with drivers. you donÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂt even need a bachelors degree to become a driver specialist. so without proper training that says a lot for the companyÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs decision making processes. if the app is on your device i would delete it immediately, because they are potentially using your gps data and other forms of data in the background, as my apple device warned me with a notification that the grubhub app was constantly tracking my location. if a company is mistreating itÃÂ£ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂs drivers with unwarranted suspensions, unethical and unfounded accusations and discrimination practices, people have an obligation to speak out to protect others. what is warranted is a class action lawsuit against grubhub for discrimination and false accusations leading to deformation and other damages against drivers. the more that people post complaints, the better the chances that grubhub will lose business for being shady. also, if you know any restaurant owners, my recommendation is to tell them how grubhub is treating their drivers in an effort to convince them to stop using grubhub until they improve morally and ethically how they treat drivers/human beings. please tell your friends and family to stop using grubhub to help push the message of fair treatment. to finalize, since grubhub likes to toss around false accusations, i have a theory of my own; in my opinion, grubhub may be potentially perpetuating a scam by temporarily taking on new drivers in order to receive government subsidies and/or tax incentives offered to companies per worker during covid relief efforts, with the sole intention of getting rid of those unsuspecting and innocent drivers shortly after. as once grubhub receives any possible financial government subsidies/tax incentives, they may be falsely accusing and removing drivers who satisfied that government financial incentive. a potential scam/ fraud that could possibly be costing the taxpayers millions. grubhub needs to be investigated for fraud to make sure this is not the case, and if it is the case that this fraud does not continue and that they are severally penalized with high fines. ensuring that the drivers who have been effected emotionally and financially during these tragic times, are made whole again. if anyone is reading my take on what has happened to me and others in this interesting review, please spread the word to those who can help. send a message to your congressman. thanks!",3/30/2021 21:20,grubhub,apple,permission,,,,0

then today, i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt receive my order. the app showed that the dasher was arriving but she never showed up. i tried to contact the dasherÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs phone, but their number doesnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt work (which i find suspicious). i looked at the app and website to get the doordash customer service phone number but couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt find one. i had to chat with someone just to get help regarding my order. i wanted to get refunded to my applepay, but they said it will take 5-7 business days. so i decided to have my doordash account credited and immediately re-ordered my food(because i was so hungry).

i was trying to put in an order while at work but since iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂve had them deliver to my house thatÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs the address it was trying to send it too. before finalizing the order i changed the address and delivery instructions and placed the order. the app must have bugged out because when it let me start tracking the order it said it was going to be delivered to my home. i tried to change it myself without cancelling the order but realized i couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt so i called grubhub. the lady had me on hold after i told her the problem and she said she was going to try to get a hold of the driver to tell them the new address. a few minutes on hold she finally comes back and says since thereÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs no driver assigned yet she said once there was one assigned she would have them call/text me for the new address and instructions. about almost 20 minutes later (maybe like 25/30 minutes after placing the order?) it finally shows itÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs on route. i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt get a call or text like i was told so i went into the chat system to make sure the driver was going to the right place. after a few pretty unnecessary ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂconfirmationÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ questions i was getting pretty annoyed, i told them the driver was about to turn down my street and for the third time gave them the right address and that they need to tell him where to go. the worker tells me sheÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs not answering her phone and that they gave her the new address (although my driver was a he, not she). the map is completely blank at that point, i canÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt see where the driver is and they canÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt get a hold of them and it seems like theyÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂre not even trying to so i ask for the drivers number so i can try to help them out (i know most companyÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs donÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt give out info like that but since the lady on the phone told me the driver would text or call me when they picked up my order, i assumed that they could?). after hearing nothing back for a while and not knowing where on earth the driver is i called and cancelled my order. i was half an hour past my scheduled lunch and i needed to clock out and find something to eat. i finally get a response back on the chat and i told them i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt need anymore help and that i cancelled. the worker said they were reading through my old chats and then messaged 10 minutes later saying that they cancelled the order and issued a refund (although i already called in and cancelled). i wanted to check to make sure the driver wasnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt still trying to find me so i asked if he was notified, and that i felt bad that he had to run around (because of an issue that wasnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt even my fault). i got a message back saying he would know when the order got cancelled, and that he would have a bad day after hearing i cancelled. the way they said(typed) it made it sound like they were saying it was my fault and they asked if i needed further assistance. i said no and ended the chat and went back to my lunch. i was still pretty ticked off about the whole thing so i tried to give feedback/file some sort of complaint through the chat system and after the worker ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂlooked into itÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ and asked me if that was the reason i cancelled it, he told me they couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt give out any personal information (like that was the only thing wrong out of the situation). i told him i know that and that i still wanted to file the complaint since their communication was so bad through the whole ordeal and i got no response back, so i closed my phone and had to go back to work. i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt get any confirmation that they actually took my feedback so now here i am, writing this review. honestly iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂm just going to go back to uber eats, taco bell isnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt worth dealing with grubhubs awful communication and customer service.",2/17/2019 22:25,grubhub,apple,personal info,,,,1

1,"i am beside myself. these people are thieves.

i've been using postmates for years, and literally have spent thousands of dollars on this app. i was a postmates unlimited member for all these years, but now i've cancelled it and deleted the app because they are crooks. 

there are so often so many issues...food showing up hours late, showing up with incorrect items, showing up obviously tampered with, or not showing up at all. the app has some glich that makes it nearly impossible to report issues. i have their customer service email address luckily, so when there's an issue i email them.

most recently, i ordered 5 of the same item that cost about $10 each. the postmate informed me the store was out of that item and asked if i wanted a smaller replacement which cost $2. i agreed, he delivered 5 of the $2 item, and then i found that postmates had still charged me for the $10 items. i reached out to them, and get this: they said theyve issued me too many credits and refunds and therefore would not refund the charges for items i never received. so basically they stole from me. i tried emailing over and over again, asked to speak to a manager, for them to review the chat log between me and the postmate who delivered to me, and even to report them to the better business bureau, and they just completely ignored my emails. there is no number to call on the app. just completely shocking and enraging the level of blatant criminality and lack of care for their customers. 

let me tell you, i am not a free loader. i don't cheat the system to make a quick buck. like i said, i spent thousands of dollars on this app. sometimes hundreds in a day, buying meals for employees. what they were referencing was one incident in which recently our family's dinner didn't show up and was cancelled right before delivery time and i was left with nothing to feed my kids. and they gave me a $5 credit that would expire in 5 days. that's it. for even the greatest inconveniences like this, the most they would give to make up for it is $5 in credit, which expires in 5 days. it's insane to me. i don't even care about the money, but $5 is an insult and makes me feel completely unvalued. 

but to refuse to give me back money you illegally charged me for items i didn't get is just plain criminal. i don't know how they can get away with this. i'll be disputing it with my credit card company and not using them again. i've deleted the app so many times in the past because of all the issues i've had with them. but i keep forgetting how bad they are and reinstalling it. this time that definitely won't happen. i've never worked with such an awful company anywhere. and i never will again.

it is also important for you to know that in the past an employee from postmates sold my password info and almost a thousand dollars was charged to my card as a result. not to mention the criminals illegally using my card had my home address, where my children live! 

i'd be very weary before putting your personal info and credit card anywhere near this app. you will regret it, it's just a matter of time.",10/7/2020 7:34,postmates,apple,personal info,,,,1

also: i have noticed that some places that do use this app sometime magically disappear from the search even tho they still use it to have people order their food... if i were a business i would be pretty angry that i randomly disappear for no reason and people canÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt order their food when they should be able to. bad for business in my opinion

1,"i downloaded this app to get a delivery from pita jungle tempe on 3/26. after precise estimate updates provided on the food order it never got delivered despite the app updates which turned out to be false. the pita jungle tempe said they prepared the food 15 minutes after the order was taken and it was given to the ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂhandlerÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ, but somehow despite having my address, phone number, and email address  details supposedly recorded and confirmed this app failed to connect the dots to deliver a service in which they exist for. 

questions to ask before downloading this app:

1. how do they lose your tracking info after making you go through entering all your personal info during sign up?
2. if they lose your info so easily how can one be assured it will not be stolen by hackers?
3. they have a poor customer service that can only offer a refund after passing 10pm restaurant closing time, so in a way this is  their way of saying ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂthanks very much for providing your personal info and being part of a social experimentÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ.
4. are they equipped to handle volumes? 
5. why should anyone tolerate this startup app glitch behavior? 

put yourself in my shoes for a moment. you barely had any decent meal for days, skipped your  breakfast and lunch so that you can have a meal and work continuously so that you wonÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt lose time in between. how would this make a human being feel like even if she/he had meals prior? for me, this is so unacceptable and if you are reading this, please do yourself a favor and avoid using them. after all we are human beings and they pretend to be a technology company and distinction in between us not even close.",3/27/2018 5:51,doordash,apple,personal info,,,,1

1,"iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂve been using door dash for quite some time without any problems, but it wasnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt until recent months that my orders werenÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt  being able to be processed. this review is based on my experience with the app and customer service on 4/26/19. 
each attempt to order resulted in an error message saying my card was declined. the debit/credit card i used had an ample amount to cover the purchase so after several attempts of resetting the app, switching to wifi, and logging in with other devices i decided to call customer service. 
my experience with customer service was sub par, to say the least. much like other reviews mentioned door dash sent an email with steps to take, but nothing fixed the issue. i wasnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt able to place an order through customer service based on their policy of obtaining personal info. 
according to the representative assisting me, there was an indication seen on his computer of a hold or freeze from my bank account.  i then called my bank to find out what was going on. they said there was no hold whatsoever. my debit card didnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt even show a declined transaction because the card was never processed by the merchant door dash. itÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs a problem with their app. so basically i was lied to by customer service and the issue has yet to be resolved. very disappointed. zero stars",4/28/2019 1:38,doordash,apple,personal info,,,,1

1,"so iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂve had this app a while - i prefer to use uber eats - but i saw an email ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂgive $100 get $100ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ - basically sign a friend up they get $100 off on delivery and if they use it you get $100 off on delivery.

too good to be true? i should have known. i had my mother sign up thinking we would both get deals. she canÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt get around much so delivery sounded perfect.

yeah... it worked once on her phone before expiring. it gave me the $100 valid for a month (whatever..) then when i went to use it, the promo was expired. never got to use it, 9 days old.

it says the expiration date is 1/1/19. itÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs currently 12/10/18... iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂve sent the picture proof to postmates. no answer.

scam. they just wanted our personal information. be weary who you give your information out too. 

itÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs a shame. i will make sure i give a bad review where i can. people should know your trickery.",12/11/2018 4:48,postmates,apple,personal info,,,,1

update:
uber eats customer service is located in india 

 i have had 3 recent orders for delivery using uber eats where the order was missing items, the order was incorrect or the uber driver took over an hour to get from the restaurant to my apartment when it should have only taken 15 minutes thus delivering the order cold and a mess.  on all three occasions uber gave me $5 uber credits to use on my next order. not once has uber honored the $5 uber credits. not only that, uber emails me various promotional offers such as $10 off your next 2 orders and $7 off you next order. again, every time i go to use these promotional offer codes, uber refuses to honor them. i was using the promotional offer codes well within the conditions set forth by uber.  after mentioning how upset i am with uber to fellow co-workers, several of my co-worker have had very similar experiences with uber as well.  uber is intentionally using the ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂbait and switchÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ con on its customers. uber gives you promotional codes to use on your order with the promise of reducing the cost, only to find out that the promotional offer code promised does not show up on your receipt and you end up paying the full amount of your order. what use is the promotional offer code than if they do not honor it. again, i was using the promotional offer code well within the guidelines of the offer. also, uber refuses to fix their error after the charge on your credit/debt card goes through. the only recourse left to me was to call my bank and ask to reverse the charges. that alone cause a bit of paper work to fill out from my bank plus having to print the promotional codes used and having to print the receipts.

1,"iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂve used postmates for years and have increasingly felt that their charges have gone up and their service has decreased.

however, after my last order, iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂm deleting my account and will suggest to my friends and you, review-readers, to use a different delivery app (door dash and seamless are better).

for my last delivery, my postmate opted to use her own gps as opposed to the in-app. however she entered the entirely wrong street and so drove 40 minutes away. she entered ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂgrove,ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ i live on ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂgrant.ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ which is fine, thatÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs human error. granted, a pretty avoidable one. 

but then, i contacted postmates support so that they could confirm i was not charged a higher delivery charge for this extra time/distance. instead of answering my question, they repeatedly sent me the itemized receipt. i am perfectly capable of reading a receipt, but theirs does not actually break down delivery price beyond stating what it was (not showing price per time/distance). nor were their representatives elaborating on the actual breakdown of charges. we went through this loop for a whileÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂthem sending me the receipt and offering ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂapologies,ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ me asking them to confirm i was not overcharged, them never actually answering my question, or at this point, refunding at least the delivery charge. 

finally, i asked them to delete my account. i kid you not, they replied ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂat this time, we cannot delete your account due to privacy concerns. we appreciate your understanding.ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ obviously, no, i did not understand. what privacy concerns? please elaborate. i emailed from my address used on the account and you canÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt delete your account in-app. what are these concerns? and who are they protecting? you canÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt just toss that out there and expect i should have this account that i cannot delete linked to my name, address, and credit card. i replied as much, and they have since managed to delete my account. and express remorse that ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂi no longer want to be part of the postmates community.ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ so sad. ):

i know, i as a consumer (pro-sumer?) am just as much part of the problem. i should, and will, take my dollar elsewhere. iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂm sure the postmates themselves make a fraction of the cost. i probably should stop ordering food, and maybe cook something. iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂm also sure my delivery person was a fine lady who made a dumb mistake. and these service representatives iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂve been emailing are decent people who have to stick to a script (if theyÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂre not just bots) they, like so many of us, are probably just cogs in the machine of late capitalism. i donÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt expect them as individuals to be perfect, but the company as a whole could definitely do more to either answer my question or refund my delivery fee. or, at least, delete my account with pushback. 

i have too much time today. and iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂm just irritated enough to write this. normally, iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂd have let it go by now, but also, a massive company should also take accountability. people, like my postmate, deserve a break. multimillion dollar businesses donÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt. i appreciate their corporate, scripted apologies, but i canÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt really put those in my bank account. or eat them.",12/29/2019 22:00,postmates,apple,privacy,,,,1

1,"to start, there are problems with the app not notifying you when orders come in. second, the app tracks your gps location everywhere in the background, even when the app is not on. i presume they are probably making money from this data like selling your info to the police departments during blm protests or any other protests to identify protesters. if you are a driver for another company they are more than likely using your data to track their competitors flow of business and customer base by recording your gps movements. i realized this was a possibility earlier on and limited grubhubÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs access to my gps location to only allowing full access when i was using the app, preventing any possible unethical gathering of my information and their competitors customer base information, which they could use in various ways, including targeted marketing. the app wonÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt even work without giving full ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂalways on precise location accessÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ to run in the background forcing me to toggle on and off permissions just to run the app, which is a big red flag. my recommendation is to delete the grubhub app asap. also, if you are deciding on becoming a driver for grubhub, i would rethink that decision. a few weeks ago my account was suspended for no reason. for weeks i did not receive any detailed response to my emails asking an explanation for the temporary suspension. just a link to a form to contact their driver care specialist. after several times trying to get an answer by phone and by email, i was finally able to get a response by phone through grubhub customer support where i inquired about the suspension. i was told that there was a fraud note listed on my account, and that a diner/customer reported that they didnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt receive their food. i have delivered thousands of orders with other companies with no problems and i have a positive rating of 100% delivery with those other competitors. i wouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt risk losing my account for a simple food order. they said they would investigate and everything should be fine. well weeks later they said they reactivated my account in which they stated in an email i received from pedro m.;

thank you for reaching out. 

we paused your account for a short period of time. we appreciate your patience. 

we have reactivated your account.

please be aware that if this activity continues, it may affect your ability to continue to partner with us.

yet my account is still not activated and i still did nothing wrong to deserve any of this. so, in dealing with grubhub it is just not worth going through the stress of being falsely accused of doing something wrong. my recommendation is to stick with driving for another company and stay far away from grubhub. i am so glad i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt sacrifice too much time and potentially mess up my working relationship with their competitors, just for grubhub. it is best just to delete the app asap to safeguard your privacy, and save yourself time and the headache of dealing with them, as their driver specialists are obviously not trained enough to realize their unethical practices when dealing with drivers. you donÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt even need a bachelors degree to become a driver specialist. so without proper training that says a lot for the companyÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs decision making processes. if the app is on your device i would delete it immediately, because they are potentially using your gps data and other forms of data in the background, as my apple device warned me with a notification that the grubhub app was constantly tracking my location. if a company is mistreating itÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs drivers with unwarranted suspensions, unethical and unfounded accusations and discrimination practices, people have an obligation to speak out to protect others. what is warranted is a class action lawsuit against grubhub for discrimination and false accusations leading to deformation and other damages against drivers. the more that people post complaints, the better the chances that grubhub will lose business for being shady. also, if you know any restaurant owners, my recommendation is to tell them how grubhub is treating their drivers in an effort to convince them to stop using grubhub until they improve morally and ethically how they treat drivers/human beings. please tell your friends and family to stop using grubhub to help push the message of fair treatment. to finalize, since grubhub likes to toss around false accusations, i have a theory of my own; in my opinion, grubhub may be potentially perpetuating a scam by temporarily taking on new drivers in order to receive government subsidies and/or tax incentives offered to companies per worker during covid relief efforts, with the sole intention of getting rid of those unsuspecting and innocent drivers shortly after. as once grubhub receives any possible financial government subsidies/tax incentives, they may be falsely accusing and removing drivers who satisfied that government financial incentive. a potential scam/ fraud that could possibly be costing the taxpayers millions. grubhub needs to be investigated for fraud to make sure this is not the case, and if it is the case that this fraud does not continue and that they are severally penalized with high fines. ensuring that the drivers who have been effected emotionally and financially during these tragic times, are made whole again. if anyone is reading my take on what has happened to me and others in this interesting review, please spread the word to those who can help. send a message to your congressman. thanks!",3/30/2021 21:20,grubhub,apple,privacy,,,,1

1,"i did not have a problem with my order, nor was i disappointed with the order. 

my only reason for canceling the order was because i needed to change the time of the delivery, and i could not get in contact with anyone at uber eats to make that change. i did contact the restaurant, and i did tell them that i needed to delay the order, which they agreed to do. they responded that they did not start on the order and that they would wait.

i contacted uber eats to see if they could assist with changing the delivery time, but unfortunately the recording stated that they were unable to provide phone support. so i contacted that restaurant again, and they recommended that i cancel the order, and then place the order again with the correct time. 

please note, i did not have any issues with the food, or the restaurant, or the order. i only canceled the order because that was the only way that i could change the delivery time of the order.

 after i canceled the order, i placed the exact same order again in uber eats. only this time, instead of paying $40.80, i had to pay $58.18 for the same order. this was my first time ordering in uber eats, so i had a $20 promotion. when i placed the order the second time, the app will not allow me to use that $20 promotion. not only that, but i was also charged a $28 cancellation fee for the other order. this was definitely not a good first time experience with this app. 

what i am asking at this point, is if there a way to honor the $20 promotion that i had with the first order that i had to cancel, and if there is anyway possible to waive the $28 cancellation fee? 

again, the only reason for the cancellation was to change the delivery time. i didnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt have any problems with the order, or with the restaurant. everything worked out fine and the food was fine.

i just need to know if you can honor the $20 promotion that i was supposed to receive. and, also if the $28 cancellation fee can be waived, due to i placed the exact same order in your app.

please help me with this. so far i have not received the assistance that i am needing. thank you!

ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂ· 

""hi shelly,

sorry to know about the trouble caused here and your order has been cancelled. the situation you have described is certainly not the experience we expect you to have.

we understand that this may be inconvenient for getting charged for the order never received.

since the order was cancelled more than 5 minutes after being placed, the restaurant/store had already accepted the order and started preparing it.

donot worries because i've also made a note with the restaurant about this issue and be sure that your feedback has been heard regarding this matter. please be assured that we're always working on improving our app, and your feedback helps us accomplish this goal.

in the future, please make sure your order is accurate before submitting it.

moreover, please be guided by the following when canceling an order. we've done this to help streamline the process and to save time:

- if you cancel after the restaurant has accepted your order, you will be refunded the delivery fee and any applicable busy area fee, but will pay for the cost of the food item(s) ordered, plus tax.

- lastly, if you cancel after the restaurant has marked the item(s) as ready for pick up, there will be no refund.

i hope this information helps. otherwise, please respond to this message with the details of what went wrong so we can help you further.""

1,"i have used postmates often and was even a member.  eversince last year this company does not care about the safety of their customers.

since postmates will employ anyone who has eys and legs their service is terrible.  the postmates drivers try and scam all the time.  if the restaurant messes up the order, resulting in the customer to not receive the food they ordered.  the postmates driver will then wait at the restaurant for a new postmates order to come in and make it look like they are dropping off two orders.    

the reason the driver does this is because when they get to your residence, they push the delivery completed.  remember all they have to be in is in the vicinity of your residence. 

postmates tried doing this to me but i was already outside. as soon as i noticed the drivers car i walked to it and once they saw me walking to their car they sped off so unsafely it was ridiculous.  in the end postmates did not care at all and would issues me a postmates credit of 5 dollars for a meal never received.  my letter of intent is on its ways.  know much, much more of the ins and outs of postates.  drivers really do eat your fries and touch your food and so do their friends.  

lastly, data collection from the app - postmates is being bought by uber. uber collects all you personal data while in transit and an additional 10 minutes after you have arrived at at your destination. this is done so they can log your data and where you go after you were being dropped off. apps go way beyond what cookies can do although they are similar in nature there really is no behind the scenes to check and verify it unless you are a developer. prepare to have your data collected transferred, and sold and then sold again and again.  they will know everything about you and your daily routine. people need to start taking this part very seriously because your data is going to become compromised on a regular basis. and the fact that a company that is supposed to be providing a service is really getting most of their profits selling your private/data. support your local restaurants by doing takeout directly through them. forget these companies that claim to provide a service but really they are breadwinning operation is in launching new updates within their app which really is a basic re-design but they never include in the update description all the modifications to the data collection they have made. for example you may say only use my data while i access the app, but the logic really has been designed for various apps to continue to collect data for another 10 to 15 minutes just so they can gather as much information about you and then sell it as much as possible. and remember your data being transferred to an affiliate means that affiliate i can now sell it to a third-party so donÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt let anybody tell you that your data is not sold or transferred. and honestly you would never really now until itÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs too late.",11/25/2020 18:54,postmates,apple,private,,,,1

1,"i revised my review here, because after throwing a fit by opening multiple complaint threads for the same order, and eventually sending their facebook profile page a private message, i got my well-deserved money back from uber eats.

 my delivered order was lacking some items i paid for. i got a refund on one item at first by complaining via in-app message (they have no customer support phone line). i asked for the rest of what was missing to be refunded, and waited for hours. the cs agent that responded then refunded 20 cents from the second missing item, and charged my card again because they cancelled out the first refund. 

i got very upset at her not answering my complaints and trying to close out the complaint thread and ticket. i threatened to go to small claims court so their lawyer could discover my evidence and settle immediately. it wasnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt about the $10-15. i figured they might listen to their own lawyer over me, a ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂgold-levelÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ customer they obviously donÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt care about. maybe someone would get fired, i hoped. 

they need oversight on who can deem a support ticket completed or not, and who responds. they canÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt act like everybody with a valid complaint is a nuisance just because uber doesnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt have a phone line and their reps want to avoid conflict. thatÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs not how it works in the business world, nor any land with reasonable laws. i am awaiting my refunds now, but will never deal with them again. not worth the time or energy to prevent them from stealing my money.",5/7/2020 8:38,ubereats,apple,private,facebook,,,0

1,"i have been a loyal customer for years (basically since these guys first started out and their prices were ridiculous - but hey, food delivery from basically any takeout restaurant without having to peel myself away from my netflix binge, i'm there). anyway, probably placed 50-60 orders and never had a problem with the service until recently (sometimes the restaurant would cause a bit of a delay, but never the driver's fault). about a week ago, i placed a large postmates order from an italian place for my family - probably $200 of italian (not my typical $10 chik-fil-a / taco bell, so i understand this looks inconsistent with my previous order pattern). some crazy red flag must have been put up because not only did they cancel my order (we had to place the order directly through the restaurant and pick it up), but i got an email shortly thereafter saying that my account has been put on hold. okay, that's fine, inconvenienced but i get it, just trying to protect me. the kicker is that in the email, they said that the only way to remove my account from hold was to provide proof of id / proof of address (giving a utility bill as an example)... what?! i did not provide either of these private documents to sign up for the service, and i'm certainly not going to provide them now (quite honestly, has all the makings of a scam and me looking like a doofus when my identification gets stolen all because i wanted a chalupa and a chicken quesadilla). i responded to the generic email saying that i feel uncomfortable providing this information only to receive essentially the exact same email in response to my response. in this email, i wrote that i have never been asked by doordash or any other food delivery service to provide this information and included the following: ""i will be deleting the postmates app and ceasing to use your service moving forward and will be sure to spread the word about this incident. this food delivery service has gone way downhill and is no longer the best option in a very crowded industry."" good luck, postmates.",3/24/2017 16:08,postmates,apple,private,,,,0

2,"i live in a highly populated ct city and despite numerous requests to uber customer service, uber maps continues to incorrectly route drivers away from my home delivery street address to an entirely different street where private gated entrance is located. as a work around, iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂve repeatedly tried to contact uber drivers to advise of mapping error however drivers are unwilling to travel a route other than the mapped directions.

i have worked in customer service for years in a variety of upscale industries including high end restaurant, retail, and private jets. an adequate handling of this situation would have been a credit to my card on file or at the very least an extension of the expiration of the credit on the app, with a kind response like, ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂour policy states that credits expire. as a one-time concession i am extending your expiration because we hope to retain you as a customer and your business is important to us.ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ by refusing to help or offer any kind of concession, postmates has successfully robbed me of my money for food i never received.

1,"i want to share one of the worst customer service experiences i recently had during 3 calls with 4 different individuals. about 30 minutes after i placed my order i received a notification email that delivery was being attempted unsuccessfully. it was then that i realized the address for the order was set to a random address nearby but not to my set ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂhomeÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ location on the app. i did not catch it when i placed the order, because i've used the app before and this error had never presented itself before. i had no reason to believe the app would make such an error. 
 
i received a phone call around the same time as the email notification, but when i answered, although i could hear that someone was on the other line, they did not respond and they hung up while i kept saying ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂhelloÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ.  i called right back and got the corporate customer service menu; when i was unable to reach someone, i began to redial, and i asked my sister to also call from her phone so we could double our chances of reaching a representative quickly to correct the issue. when someone finally answered, it was on my sisterÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs phone that is not tied to my account (important, because they later tried to indicate we were using an ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂincorrect phone number.ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ)
 
the first person we talked to verified my address and the phone number on the account, and we quickly straightened up the wrong-address issue. he called the driver and told us that the driver was 5 minutes away and on his way to us. knowing that i should take some responsibility for not realizing the app had not captured my set ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂhomeÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ address, i was grateful that they were willing to work with us.

much later, still no delivery, so we called again. this representative (after again verifying address and phone ) called the same driver who said he had decided to deliver another order first and now needed gas, but would deliver to us next, in about 10 minutes.again, feeling that the driver had been inconvenienced because of the address issue, i did not raise a fuss, but wondered privately why no one had communicated the change of plans to us (in app or email or whatever).
 
even later when there was still no delivery, we called a third time, and this time we were told that the order had already been delivered to the first wrong address, (apparently during the same time the first rep had been telling us that the driver would be at our door in 5 minutes) . this third rep appeared to have no knowledge of what we had been told by the previous 2 representatives, and seemed not to care at all. this was mind boggling, so we proceeded to ask for a ""supervisor"" . her reluctance to listen to our story, her failure to research the previous 2 calls, and her predisposition to believe we were lying, resulted in the ultimate worst client experience i've had this year. more than 2 hours after the order had initially been placed, the ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂsupervisorÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ reluctantly agreed to refund the order just to get us off the phone. there was no attempt to apologize, no discussion of how to make it right, no attempt to offer to take  a new order, or attempt to give us the benefit of the doubt.

my second experience with customer service i explained how i paid for a service that was never rendered, and would like my money back in full refund and should not be punished by rewarding a poor service i never received. the person was very nice and said he would take care of it. 

my third experience with customer service this morning, was when i received an email with a credit of ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ9.99ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ back to my account. they still are somehow trying to keep my other $20. (my original order was 29.95). 

this is absolutely unacceptable and the pinnacle of what i would call ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂbad businessÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ i truly enjoyed this app, but after this i can no longer in good faith recommend it to any of my friends or family or my network. 

if doordash wants to keep my $29.95, they have now gained a lifetime strong advocate against them, who will gladly promote all of their competitors.",2/23/2019 18:08,doordash,apple,private,,,,0
1,rip off of century nothing but lies scams and missleading! you. tell me why is it i ordered a chicken sandwich meal with a sprite and got charged $32.95. on the website the menu will give you favorable prices dream prices of items that you thought costed way more and they'll offer them to you for about $30 cheaper than retail value then you place your order and at the end they tell you we're going to have charged your card 30% of the cost plus the cost for reason for what reason i do not know why then the driver comes to you and then notify you that oh it looks like your private your food cost actually more than what we quoted you so the $10 you said is going to cost me is actually $28 okay it's not a problem but then and then $32.98 go play somebody else!!! thieves,10/7/2018 6:58,postmates,google,private,,,,0
1,"shame shame shame what an awful business model i have no idea how you guys have a four stars rating. why was my order canceled?
we apologize that your delivery was canceled. there are a few reasons that might cause your order to be canceled. some of those reasons include:

the merchant is closed due to a private event, emergency, or a change in their operating hours.
the merchant is too busy to take new orders.
the merchant cannot accept payments due to an equipment malfunction.
the merchant is cash-only. postmates cannot place orders at cash-only merchants.
if your order is canceled, you will receive a text message, email, or push notification explaining the reason for the cancelation. to prevent other customers from running into the same issue, we will temporarily deactivate the merchant on our platform until the issue is resolved. rest assured that we will investigate the reason behind the cancelation to prevent it from happening in the future.

1,"i order food all the times when iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂm at work and sometimes when i am at home too. 
a couple of days ago i ordered through postmates because my husband downloaded the app and paid for the one time fee for a year to use their services.
i placed my order around 11:30pm it said it would take 45 minutes to arrive. so i waited about 1 hour when i finally thought the delivery person should be arriving i called to a phone number that was on website for delivery service (415)767-0854 (disconnected/ no answer) after a while i received a call from a number that said scam around 1:ish in the morning. at this point i was furious i told the security guard in my building i was waiting for my food to arrive and to please take it to my apartment.
postmates website said food was delivered and charged around 1:25am so i wrote to them ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂwhere is my food?ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ i asked security guard if anyone delivered food and he said no

next day i emailed postmates 
this is what they wrote:

ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂin order to compensate the postmate for his time and the merchant for the items, you will still be charged for this order.ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ

1,"i received a 50$ gift card from work.  i figure, iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂll order pizza for the family. this is where my nightmare starts.  iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂve never had a doordash account, my wife has. we share a credit card.  any developers out there know what went wrong already.  doordash support?  lol they couldnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt find their way out of a cardboard box.  so i make a new account, redeem the gift card and try to pay the difference with our shared credit card.  immediately the cryptic errors start about the card being invalid.  we all know that what happened is the card was associated with my wifeÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs account, but this new account was both newly created and had a gift card redeemed.  my new account had been flagged by trust and safety.  i know it, you know it, no matter how many support folks i explained this to none could even grasp the basic facts much less do anything to help.  after an hour of failing i put in a different credit card and it worked fine

so hereÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs my advice to door dash engineering:
1) newsflash people share credit cards, i know itÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs a crazy concept but it happens.  why punish us for it?
2) donÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt sell gift cards if using them is such a huge risk to your company.  donÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt immediately block accounts for redeeming a card
3) if you have trust and safety systems like this (you do) teach your support about them.  why is the support person telling me that clearing cookies will fix this when itÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs obvious my card was flagged?
4) if you canÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt tell people their cards are flagged because that would help the scammers (this attitude is years out of date but i get it) ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ then make something about the error message a clue to support that this happened.  add a code to the error that scammers canÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt understand but you support team can. 

i hope it helps, stop hiring security people with ancient trust and safety views. provide them with some modern training and it will go along way towards improving your product and bottom line. 

most people who hit my situation would have deleted your app.

update: 2 hours now, still no pizza.  support gave me 30$ for my next order - like iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂm ever going to subject myself to this again lol.  my order has had 3 dasher assigned, 2 mysteriously disappeared. support promises this third one wonÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt. 

at this point the situation is becoming comical. itÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs like ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂcan doordash manage to move a pizza 2 miles at all?ÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ  i guess the answer is no, thatÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂs too much.  they canÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt do it lol.",2/27/2021 21:16,doordash,apple,security,,,,0

but the biggest issue is the security. i have plenty of other food delivery apps that i use and none of my accounts have been tampered with as much as my postmates account has. iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂve received two notices that someone has tried to log in my account. and i canÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt even delete my account without having to contact postmates - to which i did and they are saying it will take 5 to 7 days. to delete my account?? makes me glad to have actually not use the app and have my card in their system.

this is a complete joke of an app and iÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂll never be using it again. if someone knows how to block an app, let me know.",10/23/2020 3:30,postmates,apple,security,,,,0

hello xxx,

we know that this isn't an ideal situation, but unfortunately this is the world we live in at the moment.  that being said, we can assure you that your account has been closed and is no longer accessible.  the charges should show back up in your account in 5 - 10 business days (but possibly sooner - depending on your bank).  in most circumstances you may go to your bank's local branch to request a temporary card until your new one arrives.  if that is not an option, you can usually request them overnight one to you.

if you wish to file a police report, we will be happy to work with law enforcement to provide any information they may need to conduct a thorough investigation on your behalf.",11/24/2018 17:02,postmates,apple,security,,,,0

first, it took forever to find where to enter the promo code (a quick google suggests other people had the same problem). then, it turns out that their alleged 50% off discount actually had a fine print that capped it at $15. 

finally, when i tried to order, i entered my credit card details. the app wanted to scan it for security... and then failed to recognize it - even after i tried ten times. i even attempted to add a new card, but by that point in the order the app wouldnÃÂ£ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂt let me without starting the whole process all over again.
